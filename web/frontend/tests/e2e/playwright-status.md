# Playwright Test Status (Updated April 5, 2025)

## Overview
This document tracks the status of our Playwright E2E test suite for the Auto Shorts Web App. It provides a comprehensive reference for the current state of tests, recent changes, and known issues.

## Test Suite Status

- **Tests Passing**: 10/10
- **Test Coverage**: 85% of core functionality
- **Last Full Run**: April 5, 2025
- **Overall Status**: Stable, fully migrated to domain-specific files

## Test Organization Structure

We have fully implemented a domain-based organization for tests:

### Test Files

1. **Home Page & Navigation (`home-page.spec.ts`)**
   - Home page loads correctly
   - Navigation between pages works properly
   - Create video button navigation

2. **Project Management (`project-management.spec.ts`)**
   - Project creation and setup
   - Existing project loading and management

3. **Scene Operations (`scene-operations.spec.ts`)**
   - Scene deletion 
   - Drag and drop scene reordering

4. **Audio Generation (`audio-generation.spec.ts`)**
   - Audio generation and playback
   - Voice settings management

5. **Mock Audio Testing (`mock-audio-test.spec.ts`)**
   - Audio generation with mock API
   - API interception and verification

6. **Example Workflows (`examples/simplified-workflow.spec.ts`)**
   - End-to-end user workflow
   - Combined scene, audio, and project operations

### Domain-Specific Helpers

We've implemented a comprehensive set of domain-specific helpers:

1. **Project Utils (`project-utils.ts`)**
   - Project creation, navigation, and verification
   - Project management and cleanup

2. **Scene Utils (`scene-utils.ts`)**
   - Scene addition, deletion, and reordering
   - Scene content verification and editing

3. **Audio Utils (`audio-utils.ts`)**
   - Voice generation and playback testing
   - Audio settings management
   - Mock audio implementation

4. **Layout Utils (`layout-utils.ts`)**
   - Layout verification for UI components
   - Element positioning tests

5. **Navigation Utils (`navigation-utils.ts`)**
   - Page navigation and verification
   - Element finding and text verification

6. **Wait Utils (`wait-utils.ts`)**
   - Timing utilities and polling functions
   - Element waiting strategies

### Test Artifact Management

We've implemented a comprehensive test artifact management system:

1. **Gitignore Rules**
   - All test artifacts (screenshots, test-results directory) automatically ignored

2. **Cleanup Script**
   - Added `scripts/cleanup-test-artifacts.sh` to remove all test artifacts
   - Run with `npm run cleanup-tests`

3. **Screenshot Patterns**
   - Standardized naming conventions for different types of screenshots
   - Automatic cleanup prevents disk space issues

## Recent Improvements

1. **Complete Migration to Domain-Specific Files (100% complete)**
   - Removed core-functionality.spec.ts
   - All tests now exist in domain-specific files
   - Improved maintainability and organization

2. **Data-testid Implementation (90% complete)**
   - Added attributes to most UI components
   - Improved selector resilience
   - Created standard naming conventions

3. **Domain-Specific Helpers (100% complete)**
   - Implemented all major helper categories
   - Encapsulated common test patterns
   - Added comprehensive documentation

4. **Mock Audio System (100% complete)**
   - Implemented ElevenLabs API mocking
   - Added environment variable controls
   - Preserved test coverage without API costs

## Next Steps

1. **Enhance Test Documentation**
   - Add JSDoc comments to all helper functions
   - Create better examples of helper usage
   - Document all supported data-testid values
   - Improve navigation between documentation files

2. **Set up Visual Regression Tests**
   - Implement visual comparison for key UI components
   - Create baseline screenshots for critical UI states
   - Add visual regression tests for key components
   - Implement visual difference reporting

3. **Test Command Standardization**
   - Create more specific npm test commands
   - Add shortcuts for common test patterns
   - Improve test output formatting

4. **Future Plans**
   - Implement performance metrics collection
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline integration
   - Add accessibility testing components
