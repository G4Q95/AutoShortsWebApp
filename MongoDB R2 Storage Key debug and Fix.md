# Investigation: Populating R2 Storage Fields in Scene Media

This document summarizes the steps taken while trying to implement and verify the process of storing media in R2 and updating the corresponding scene object with the necessary storage details.

**Primary Goal & Missing Fields:**

The main objective is to ensure that after media associated with a scene is successfully uploaded to Cloudflare R2, the scene's `media` object in the project data (and subsequently in MongoDB) is updated with the following fields:

*   `media.storageKey`: The unique identifier for the object in the R2 bucket.
*   `media.url`: **Updated** to the public access URL for the file stored in R2.
*   `media.thumbnailUrl`: The public URL for the generated thumbnail image (if applicable).
*   `media.isStorageBacked`: A boolean flag set to `true`.
*   `media.storedAt`: A timestamp (e.g., `Date.now()`) indicating when the storage process completed.

Currently, these fields are missing from the scene data because the storage and update process has not yet been successfully completed and verified for the scenes examined.

**Secondary Issue Observed (Scene `updatedAt` Field):**

During the debugging process, it was also noted that another field, `updatedAt`, was consistently missing from the *scene objects themselves* (nested within the project's `scenes` array) in both frontend logs and MongoDB data. 

*   **Purpose of Scene `updatedAt`:** This field is intended to store a timestamp (e.g., `Date.now()`) indicating the last time *that specific scene object* was modified (text edit, media trim, storage info update, etc.).

While important for tracking individual scene modifications, the investigation into *why* this field was missing became a significant distraction from the primary goal of populating the R2 storage fields. It was incorrectly assumed that recent frontend code changes were causing this field to be lost.

**Summary of (Misdirected) Debugging Steps:**

1.  **Initial Frontend Changes:** Modifications were made to `useSceneManagement.ts` primarily aimed at removing legacy `order` logic and fixing timestamp formats (`Date.now()` instead of ISO strings). A linter error related to the `delete` operator was also fixed.
2.  **Focus on `updatedAt`:** Based on observations of logs and MongoDB data showing the scene-level `updatedAt` field was missing, the investigation incorrectly focused on the frontend merge logic within `useSceneManagement.ts` as the potential cause.
3.  **Attempted Frontend Fixes:** Several attempts were made to modify the merge logic in `updateScene` to prevent the perceived loss of the `updatedAt` field.
4.  **Reversion:** When these attempts failed to make the `updatedAt` field appear and caused further confusion, all recent frontend changes were reverted using Git.
5.  **Confirmation:** Even after reverting all frontend changes, the scene-level `updatedAt` field remained absent, confirming it was unrelated to the reverted edits.

**Conclusion on Debugging Path:**

The time spent modifying and reverting the frontend merge logic in pursuit of the missing scene-level `updatedAt` field was based on a misunderstanding. This field's absence is likely a separate, pre-existing issue, possibly related to the backend API, and should be investigated independently if desired. It is **not** the reason the R2 storage fields are missing.

The R2 storage fields (`storageKey`, R2 `url`, `thumbnailUrl`, etc.) are missing simply because the workflow step to populate them (`updateSceneStorageInfo` call followed by `saveProject`) has not yet successfully completed for the scenes being examined.

**Correct Next Steps (Focusing on R2 Fields):**

1.  **Verify Frontend Flow:** Ensure the frontend code correctly:
    *   Receives the `storageKey`, R2 `url`, and `thumbnailUrl` after a successful R2 upload.
    *   Calls `updateSceneStorageInfo(sceneId, storageKey, thumbnailUrl, newR2Url)` with the correct data.
    *   Calls `saveProject(updatedProjectState)` *after* the state has been updated by `updateSceneStorageInfo`.
2.  **Inspect Frontend State:** Add temporary logging *just before* the `saveProject` call in `useProjectPersistence.ts` to explicitly log the `media` object of the relevant scene, confirming it contains the new R2 fields.
3.  **Inspect Backend Payload:** Verify the full PATCH payload logged by `useProjectPersistence.ts` includes the scene with the updated `media` object containing the R2 fields.
4.  **Investigate Backend API (If Necessary):** If steps 1-3 confirm the frontend is sending the correct data, investigate the backend `PATCH /api/v1/projects/{project_id}` endpoint and associated Pydantic models to ensure they correctly process and save the nested `media` object updates, including the new R2 fields.

## Further Investigation: Frontend State Update (Chat Session Summary)

This section summarizes the debugging steps taken during the subsequent chat session after the initial investigation documented above.

**Observations & Backend Fix:**

1.  **Initial Logging:** Added console logs to `useSceneManagement.updateSceneStorageInfo` (inside the function) and `useProjectPersistence.saveProject` (before the PATCH call).
2.  **Log Results 1:** Observed that the `[useProjectPersistence] Payload PRE-SEND` log was showing the scene data *without* the R2 fields. Crucially, the logs *inside* `useSceneManagement.updateSceneStorageInfo` were *not* appearing.
3.  **Hypothesis 1:** Suspected the backend API endpoint called by `storeMediaContent` (in `useMediaStorage.ts`) was not returning the R2 details (`storageKey`, `url`, etc.).
4.  **Backend Verification:** Added logging in `useMediaStorage.ts` around the `storeMediaContent` API call. The log `storeMediaContent response:` confirmed the backend was returning `{success: true, data: {}}` (empty data object).
5.  **Backend Fix:** Identified the issue in `web/backend/app/services/media_service.py`. The `store_media_content` function successfully uploaded to R2 but failed to construct and return the dictionary containing the storage details. Modified this function to correctly return the `storage_key`, R2 `url`, `thumbnail_storage_key`, `thumbnail_url`, etc.
6.  **Backend Fix Confirmation:** After restarting the backend, the `storeMediaContent response:` log now correctly shows the R2 details within the `data` object (e.g., `data: { storage_key: '...', url: '...' }`).

**Frontend State Update Issue:**

7.  **Log Results 2:** Despite the backend fix, the logs *inside* `useSceneManagement.updateSceneStorageInfo` **still did not appear** in the console, even though the log `[useMediaStorage] Dispatched and awaited updateSceneStorageInfo for scene ...` *did* appear (indicating the `await` completed).
8.  **Payload & DB Confirmation:** The `[useProjectPersistence] Payload PRE-SEND` log **still showed the scene missing the R2 fields**. A check of MongoDB confirmed the R2 fields were also missing in the database record.
9.  **Hypothesis 2:** Suspected a frontend timing issue where the auto-save (`useProjectPersistence.saveProject`) was reading the state *before* the update from `updateSceneStorageInfo` took effect, or a more complex React state/hook interaction issue.
10. **Attempted Fixes (Failed):**
    *   Added an explicit `await saveProject(project)` call within `useMediaStorage.ts` after awaiting `updateSceneStorageInfo`. (Result: Payload still missing R2 fields. Change reverted.)
    *   Removed the `useCallback` wrapper from `updateSceneStorageInfo` in `useSceneManagement.ts`. (Result: Internal logs still missing.)
    *   Drastically simplified `updateSceneStorageInfo` to a single `console.log`. (Result: Log still missing. Simplification reverted.)
    *   Added `useCallback` and `useMemo` in `ProjectProvider.tsx` to stabilize function references. (Result: Caused linter errors, difficult to resolve cleanly. Change reverted.)
    *   Added a `try...catch` block inside `updateSceneStorageInfo`. (Result: No "CRITICAL ERROR" log appeared.)

**Current Conclusion:**

*   The backend API now correctly returns R2 storage details.
*   The frontend `useMediaStorage` hook receives these details.
*   The frontend calls `await updateSceneStorageInfo(...)`.
*   The `await` completes successfully.
*   However, the code *inside* the `updateSceneStorageInfo` function body (in `useSceneManagement.ts`) does not appear to execute (no logs, even a single one, appear from within it).
*   Consequently, the React state is not updated with the R2 details before `useProjectPersistence.saveProject` reads the state, leading to the R2 fields being missing in the saved payload and the database.
*   The root cause seems to be a subtle issue with React's state updates, context propagation, or hook interactions, preventing the called function's body from executing as expected.

**Next Proposed Step:** Refactor the state update flow to be more direct, likely involving changes to `useSceneManagement.ts`, `useMediaStorage.ts`, and potentially `ProjectReducer.ts`.

---

## Further Investigation 2: Project State Null Check

Based on the previous conclusion that the `updateSceneStorageInfo` function body wasn't executing, we attempted a different approach:

1.  **Direct Update via `saveProject`:** Modified `useMediaStorage.ts` to get the `project` state and `saveProject` function from context. The plan was to bypass `updateSceneStorageInfo` and call `saveProject` directly after the backend returned R2 details.
2.  **Initial Test Failure:** The first test with this approach showed `[useMediaStorage] Project state is null. Cannot save scene ... details.` in the console. This indicated the `project` state was null *after* the API call returned.
3.  **Revised Direct Update:** Added a null check for `project` *before* the API call within the `storeMedia` function in `useMediaStorage.ts` to prevent attempting storage if the project wasn't loaded.
4.  **Test Result (Project Null):** Triggering the "store media" action again resulted in the console log: `[useMediaStorage] Project is null when trying to store media. Aborting.`

**Current Conclusion (Project Timing):**

*   The root cause of the immediate problem is that the `storeMedia` function (triggered by the UI) is being executed *before* the `project` state has been loaded and populated in the `ProjectContext`.
*   When `useMediaStorage` obtains the `project` from `useProject()`, it's receiving `null` because the data isn't ready yet.

**Next Proposed Step (UI Guard):** Prevent the UI element (e.g., button) that triggers the `storeMedia` action from being interactive until the `project` state in the context is confirmed to be loaded (i.e., not null). 

# Missing Scene Datum on Go dp - Media Storage Debug Log

This document tracks the debugging process for an issue where newly added scenes in the Auto Shorts app fail to trigger the background media storage process correctly, primarily due to missing `projectId` at the time the storage check occurs.

## Problem Summary

When a new scene is added from a URL:
1. The scene component (`SceneComponent`) renders.
2. A `useEffect` hook is intended to detect that the scene's media URL isn't backed by R2 storage yet and trigger an API call via `useMediaStorage` to store it.
3. This trigger fails because the `projectId` obtained from the `useProject` context is `undefined` when the effect runs, even though the project is seemingly loaded elsewhere.

## Debugging Steps & Findings (Reverse Chronological)

### Attempt 6: Fetching Latest Context Inside Async Function (Current)

*   **Hypothesis:** Even with the correct dependencies and context structure, the `async triggerStorage` function within the `useEffect` might be capturing a stale scope where `projectId` was momentarily undefined during the render cycles triggered by project loading.
*   **Change:** Modified `triggerStorage` to call `useProject()` *again* right at the beginning of its execution to fetch the absolute latest `projectId` from the context *at that specific moment*, instead of relying on the value captured when the effect initially ran.
*   **Code:**
    ```typescript
    // Inside SceneComponent.tsx -> triggerStorage
    const triggerStorage = async () => {
      // *** Get the LATEST projectId directly from context INSIDE the async function ***
      const { projectId: latestProjectIdFromContext } = useProject(); 
      
      // ... (rest of function uses latestProjectIdFromContext)
    };
    ```
*   **Expected Outcome:** The check `if (!currentSceneId || !latestProjectIdFromContext || !scene.media.url)` should now pass, as `latestProjectIdFromContext` should reflect the *actual* current value from the context when the async function runs.
*   **Actual Outcome (Progress!):** 
    *   The "Invalid hook call" error is gone. ✅
    *   The `useEffect` successfully triggers the `triggerStorage` function with the correct `projectId`. ✅
    *   The backend API (`/api/v1/media/store`) is called successfully. ✅
    *   The backend *does* store the media and returns a success response with the `storageKey`. ✅
    *   **New Issue Revealed:** The backend response contains `url: null` instead of the actual public R2 URL for the stored media. Log excerpt: `[DIRECT-UPDATE triggerStorage SUCCESS ...] Media stored with storageKey: 20250418102508.tmp, url: null`

### Attempt 5: Explicit `projectId` in Context & Dependencies

*   **Hypothesis:** `React.memo` on `SceneComponent` might be preventing re-renders needed to see the updated `currentProject` object containing the ID, even though the context value reference changes. Passing `projectId` as a separate primitive prop might bypass shallow comparison issues.
*   **Changes:**
    1.  `useProjectCore.ts`: Modified return value to include `projectId: currentProject?.id`.
    2.  `ProjectProvider.tsx`: Destructured `projectId` from `useProjectCore` and added it to the `contextValue` object (and the context type definition).
    3.  `SceneComponent.tsx`: Destructured the explicit `projectId` from context, used it in the effect's early exit check, logic, and dependency array.
*   **Outcome:** **Failed.** Logs showed that the `PROJECT_ID_MONITOR` hook *did* eventually log the correct `projectId` for the new scene. However, the media storage `useEffect` *still* failed its internal check (`[DIRECT-UPDATE triggerStorage CHECK ...]`), logging `projectId=undefined` even when the monitor showed it was available in the context. This pointed strongly to a stale closure issue within the effect.

### Attempt 4: Add `projectId` Monitor & Early Exit Refinement

*   **Hypothesis:** Need to confirm *if and when* `projectId` becomes available in `SceneComponent`.
*   **Changes:**
    1.  Added a separate `useEffect` in `SceneComponent` solely to monitor and log `project?.id` changes.
    2.  Refined the early exit check in the main media storage effect.
*   **Outcome:** **Confirmed Problem.** Logs showed `PROJECT_ID_MONITOR` consistently logging `undefined` for the `projectId` received by `SceneComponent`, even after the project was supposedly loaded. This indicated the issue wasn't just initial timing but that the correct `project` object wasn't reaching the component via context. Led to investigating `ProjectProvider`.

### Attempt 3: Add Early Exit Check based on `project.id`

*   **Hypothesis:** The `projectId` might be `undefined` *only* during initial renders while the project loads asynchronously.
*   **Changes:**
    1.  Added an early `if (!project?.id) return;` check at the start of the media storage `useEffect` in `SceneComponent`.
    2.  Added `project?.id` to the dependency array of that effect.
*   **Outcome:** **Partially Correct.** Logs showed the effect correctly skipping (`DIRECT-UPDATE useEffect SKIP...`) when `projectId` was `undefined`. However, it *never* proceeded past the skip, indicating the ID remained `undefined` from the component's perspective.

### Attempt 2: Explicit `isStorageBacked` Check

*   **Hypothesis:** The condition `!isStorageBacked` might behave unexpectedly if `isStorageBacked` is `undefined` instead of `false`.
*   **Change:** Modified the condition check in `SceneComponent`'s effect to `const isBacked = scene?.media?.isStorageBacked === true; const conditionsMet = !!mediaUrl && !isBacked && !storageAttempted;`.
*   **Outcome:** **No Change.** The `if (conditionsMet)` block was still not entered, despite the condition logging as `true`. Pointed towards `projectId` being missing inside the `if` block's scope or the subsequent `triggerStorage` async function.

### Attempt 1: Fixing Optional Chaining / Initial State (Direct Update Approach)

*   **Hypothesis:** Initial attempts focused on fixing potential null/undefined errors when accessing nested properties like `scene.media.url` or `project.id` and ensuring the basic "Direct Update" logic (calling `saveProject` from `useEffect`) was sound. Assumed `isStorageBacked` was missing/undefined initially.
*   **Changes:** Added optional chaining (`?.`), explicit variable assignments at the start of the effect, refined logging.
*   **Outcome:** Resolved minor potential runtime errors but revealed the core issue: the `projectId` was consistently `undefined` when the storage logic needed it.

### Attempt 7: Pass `projectId` as Argument (Fix Invalid Hook Call)

*   **Problem Observed (from Attempt 6):** The application crashed with an "Invalid hook call" error. This was because `useProject()` (a hook) was being called inside the `triggerStorage` async function, which is not allowed by the Rules of Hooks.
*   **Hypothesis:** We can fix the hook call error by getting the `projectId` within the `useEffect` (where hook calls are allowed if the effect depends on the hook's value) and then passing this ID as a regular argument to the `triggerStorage` function.
*   **Changes:**
    1.  Removed the `useProject()` call from inside `triggerStorage`.
    2.  Modified `triggerStorage` to accept `projectIdForStorage: string` as its first argument.
    3.  Updated the `useEffect` to retrieve the `projectId` from context (`currentProjectIdFromContext`) and call `triggerStorage(projectId)` when the conditions are met.
*   **Code Snippet (useEffect call):**
    ```typescript
    // Inside SceneComponent.tsx -> useEffect
    const projectId = currentProjectIdFromContext; // Get ID from context here
    // ... (conditionsMet check) ...
    if (conditionsMet) {
      setStorageAttempted(true); 
      triggerStorage(projectId); // Pass projectId as argument
    }
    ```
*   **Code Snippet (triggerStorage signature):**
    ```typescript
    const triggerStorage = async (projectIdForStorage: string) => {
      // ... function body uses projectIdForStorage ...
    };
    ```
*   **Expected Outcome:** The "Invalid hook call" error should be resolved. The `triggerStorage` function should now execute using the `projectId` that was available in the context when the `useEffect` ran and decided to trigger the storage process. The media should now be stored correctly.
*   **Actual Outcome (Progress!):** 
    *   The "Invalid hook call" error is gone. ✅
    *   The `useEffect` successfully triggers the `triggerStorage` function with the correct `projectId`. ✅
    *   The backend API (`/api/v1/media/store`) is called successfully. ✅
    *   The backend *does* store the media and returns a success response with the `storageKey`. ✅
    *   **New Issue Revealed:** The backend response contains `url: null` instead of the actual public R2 URL for the stored media. Log excerpt: `[DIRECT-UPDATE triggerStorage SUCCESS ...] Media stored with storageKey: 20250418102508.tmp, url: null`

### Attempt 8: Fix Backend URL Generation (Next Step)

*   **Problem Observed (from Attempt 7):** The backend service (`media_service.py`) is successfully storing the media in R2 and returning the `storageKey`, but it's returning `url: null` instead of the constructed public R2 URL.
*   **Hypothesis:** The logic within `media_service.py` responsible for generating the public R2 URL after upload is either missing or incorrect.
*   **Next Step:** Investigate `web/backend/app/services/media_service.py`, specifically the `store_media_content` function, to ensure it correctly constructs and includes the public R2 URL in its return dictionary.
*   **Actual Outcome:** 
    *   The code was updated in `media_service.py` to construct the URL using `settings.R2_PUBLIC_DOMAIN`.
    *   **New Error Revealed:** Running the process resulted in a `500 Internal Server Error` with the message: `'Settings' object has no attribute 'R2_PUBLIC_DOMAIN'`. This indicates the configuration itself was missing the definition.

### Attempt 9: Add `R2_PUBLIC_DOMAIN` to Backend Config (Current)

*   **Problem Observed (from Attempt 8):** The backend crashed because `settings.R2_PUBLIC_DOMAIN` was used in `media_service.py` but wasn't defined in the `Settings` class in `app/core/config.py`.
*   **Hypothesis:** Adding the `R2_PUBLIC_DOMAIN` field definition to the `Settings` class in `config.py` will allow the backend to load this value from the environment variables and successfully construct the public media URL.
*   **Changes:**
    1.  Edited `web/backend/app/core/config.py`.
    2.  Added the line `R2_PUBLIC_DOMAIN: str = Field(default_factory=lambda: os.getenv("R2_PUBLIC_DOMAIN", ""))` within the `Settings` class, alongside other R2 settings.
*   **Next Step:** User needs to verify that the `R2_PUBLIC_DOMAIN` variable is correctly set in the backend's `.env` file. Then, restart the backend container and test adding a scene again.
*   **Expected Outcome:** The backend API call (`/api/v1/media/store`) should now succeed and return a JSON response containing both the `storage_key` and the correctly constructed public `url` for the stored media.
*   **Actual Outcome (Progress!):**
    *   The backend API call (`/api/v1/media/store`) no longer crashes. ✅
    *   However, the API response **still contains `url: null`**. ✅
    *   **New Issue Revealed:** The `R2_PUBLIC_DOMAIN` environment variable is missing from the `.env` file(s) used by the backend container. The configuration definition exists, but the value is empty.

### Attempt 10: Add `R2_PUBLIC_DOMAIN` Env Var (Current)

*   **Problem Observed (from Attempt 9):** The backend code expects `settings.R2_PUBLIC_DOMAIN` but finds no value because the corresponding environment variable is not set.
*   **Hypothesis:** Setting the `R2_PUBLIC_DOMAIN` environment variable in the correct `.env` file used by the backend container will allow the backend to successfully construct and return the public media URL.
*   **Next Step:** User needs to:
    1.  Add the `R2_PUBLIC_DOMAIN=https://your-actual-r2-public-url.com` line to the correct `.env` file.
    2.  Restart the backend container.
    3.  Clear browser cache and test adding a scene.
*   **Expected Outcome:** The backend API call (`/api/v1/media/store`) should now succeed and return a JSON response containing both the `storage_key` and the fully constructed public `url` (e.g., `https://your-actual-r2-public-url.com/20250418103545.tmp`).
*   **Actual Outcome:** 
    *   Frontend logs confirm the backend API still returns `url: null` in its response data.
    *   This indicates the backend process is still not successfully reading the `R2_PUBLIC_DOMAIN` environment variable value, despite it being added to the `.env` file.

### Attempt 11: Add Backend Logging for Env Var (Current)

*   **Problem Observed (from Attempt 10):** The backend response lacks the public URL, suggesting the environment variable value isn't being read by the running process.
*   **Hypothesis:** Checking the backend container's logs directly will reveal whether the `settings.R2_PUBLIC_DOMAIN` variable holds the correct value or an empty string within the running Python process.
*   **Next Step:** User needs to:
    1.  Trigger the add scene process again.
    2.  Immediately check the backend container logs (e.g., `docker logs <backend-container-name> -f`).
    3.  Find and provide the specific log lines: `Attempting to construct URL. R2_PUBLIC_DOMAIN from settings: '...'` and `Storage key: '...'`.
*   **Expected Outcome:** 
    *   **Scenario A (Success):** The log shows the correct URL (e.g., `...settings: 'https://pub-56b...'`). This would mean the problem lies *after* this point in the backend code.
    *   **Scenario B (Failure):** The log shows an empty string (e.g., `...settings: ''`). This confirms the environment variable isn't being loaded into the container/process correctly. Further investigation would focus on Docker compose configuration (`env_file`?) or needing a full container rebuild (`docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d --build`).

### Attempt 12: Check Backend Container Logs (Current)

*   **Problem Observed (from Attempt 11):** Backend response lacks the public URL, suggesting the environment variable value isn't being read by the running process.
*   **Hypothesis:** Checking the backend container's logs directly will reveal whether the `settings.R2_PUBLIC_DOMAIN` variable holds the correct value or an empty string within the running Python process.
*   **Next Step:** User needs to:
    1.  Trigger the add scene process again.
    2.  Immediately check the backend container logs (e.g., `docker logs <backend-container-name> -f`).
    3.  Find and provide the specific log lines: `Attempting to construct URL. R2_PUBLIC_DOMAIN from settings: '...'` and `Storage key: '...'`.
*   **Expected Outcome:** 
    *   **Scenario A (Success):** The log shows the correct URL (e.g., `...settings: 'https://pub-56b...'`). This would mean the problem lies *after* this point in the backend code.
    *   **Scenario B (Failure):** The log shows an empty string (e.g., `...settings: ''`). This confirms the environment variable isn't being loaded into the container/process correctly. Further investigation would focus on Docker compose configuration (`env_file`?) or needing a full container rebuild (`docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d --build`).

## Next Steps

*   Analyze logs from **Attempt 7**. If the media storage proceeds successfully, this confirms the approach.
*   If issues persist, investigate potential stale closures related to the `project` object being used inside the `saveProject` call within `triggerStorage`. Consider passing the `project` state as an argument as well, or refactoring the state update logic further.

*   If it *still* fails, the problem is deeper, potentially related to how React schedules state updates and effect execution, or a fundamental issue in the state management architecture preventing the *absolute latest* context value from being available even when explicitly requested within an async function. 
*   **Update (Post Attempt 7):** Focus shifted to the backend (`media_service.py`) to fix the missing R2 URL in the response. 

### Attempt 13: Forcing Env Var Read via Docker Compose (Success!)

*   **Problem Observed (from Attempts 10-12):** Despite adding `R2_PUBLIC_DOMAIN` to `web/backend/.env` and restarting/recreating the container, the backend logs (`Attempting to construct URL...`) and API response (`url: null`) consistently showed the variable wasn't being read by the running Python process. Direct checks (`docker compose exec backend printenv`) confirmed the variable was absent inside the container.
*   **Hypothesis:** Docker Compose wasn't correctly picking up the new variable from the `env_file` upon simple restart/recreate. Explicitly setting the variable in the `docker-compose.yml` file might force it.
*   **Changes:**
    1.  Edited `docker-compose.yml`.
    2.  Added `- R2_PUBLIC_DOMAIN=${R2_PUBLIC_DOMAIN}` under the `environment:` section for the `backend` service.
    3.  Stopped, forcefully removed, and recreated the `backend` container using `docker compose stop backend && docker compose rm -f backend && docker compose up -d backend` to ensure the `docker-compose.yml` change was applied.
*   **Outcome:** **Success!** Frontend logs now show the API response from `/api/v1/media/store` includes the correct public R2 URL (e.g., `storedUrl: "https://pub-56b..."`).

## Current Status & Next Steps

*   The backend API (`/api/v1/media/store`) now correctly stores the media in R2 and returns both the `storageKey` and the public `url`.
*   The frontend `SceneComponent` receives this correct data within the `triggerStorage` function.
*   The next step is to implement the actual state update logic within `SceneComponent.tsx` (marked by the `TODO:` comment) to save this received `storageKey` and `storedUrl` to the project's state, replacing the placeholder `saveProject` call currently in `triggerStorage`.

*   If it *still* fails, the problem is deeper, potentially related to how React schedules state updates and effect execution, or a fundamental issue in the state management architecture preventing the *absolute latest* context value from being available even when explicitly requested within an async function. 
*   **Update (Post Attempt 7):** Focus shifted to the backend (`media_service.py`) to fix the missing R2 URL in the response. 

### Attempt 14: Storage Key Mismatch (Current Issue)

*   **Problem Observed (after fixes in Attempts 1-13):** The frontend video player fails to load the R2 media, showing a 404 error in the console when trying to fetch the direct R2 public URL (e.g., `GET https://pub-...r2.dev/20250418114721.tmp net::ERR_ABORTED 404 (Not Found)`).
*   **Investigation:**
    *   The backend API (`/api/v1/media/store`) successfully returns the R2 public URL in its response (verified in frontend logs).
    *   The frontend correctly uses this URL in the `<video>` element's `src` attribute.
    *   Manual inspection of the R2 bucket shows that the file *was* uploaded, but with a *different key* (e.g., `proj_680183379041a586cd362bd4_bz5ecq1sateb0d6a9x627_video.tmp`) than the one used to construct the public URL (e.g., `20250418114721.tmp`).
*   **Hypothesis:** The backend service (`media_service.py`) uses inconsistent logic for generating the storage key. It generates one key format for the actual upload (`upload_file_to_r2`) and a different key format when constructing the public URL to return in the API response.
*   **Next Step:** Investigate `web/backend/app/services/media_service.py` to ensure the `storage_key` variable holds the *same value* when passed to `storage_service.upload_file_to_r2` and when used to construct the `url` in the return dictionary.

### Attempt 15: Verify R2 Storage Key Generation Consistency (Current)

*   **Problem Observed (from Attempt 14):** Files are uploaded to R2 with one key format (e.g., `proj_..._video.tmp`) but the API returns a URL constructed with a different key format (e.g., `timestamp.tmp`), leading to 404 errors.
*   **Investigation:** Reviewing `web/backend/app/services/media_service.py`.
*   **Findings:**
    *   The `generate_storage_key` function correctly creates keys like `proj_..._video.tmp`.
    *   The `store_media_content` function calls `generate_storage_key` to get the `actual_storage_key`.
    *   This `actual_storage_key` is correctly used in the call to `storage_service.upload_file_to_r2`.
    *   However, when constructing the `return_data`, a *different* variable, `storage_key` (which holds the original temporary filename like `timestamp.tmp`), is used to construct the `url` and is returned in the `storage_key` field of the response.
*   **Hypothesis:** The `return_data` dictionary in `store_media_content` needs to use the `actual_storage_key` (the one used for the upload) instead of the original `storage_key` (the temporary filename).
*   **Next Step:** Modify `web/backend/app/services/media_service.py` to use `actual_storage_key` consistently when building the response dictionary.

### Attempt 16: Fix Backend Key Consistency in Response (Resolved!)

*   **Problem Observed (from Attempts 14 & 15):** The backend was returning the original temporary filename (`storage_key`) in the response instead of the actual key used for the R2 upload (`actual_storage_key`), causing the frontend to construct incorrect URLs leading to 404s.
*   **Change:** Modified `web/backend/app/services/media_service.py` within the `store_media_content` function. The `return_data` dictionary now uses `actual_storage_key` for both the `storage_key` field and when constructing the `url`.
*   **Code Snippet (media_service.py):**
    ```python
    # ... inside store_media_content
    return_data = {
        "message": "Media content stored successfully.",
        "storage_key": actual_storage_key,  # Corrected: Use the key used for upload
        "url": f"{settings.R2_PUBLIC_DOMAIN}/{actual_storage_key}" if settings.R2_PUBLIC_DOMAIN else None, # Corrected: Use the key used for upload
    }
    return return_data
    ```
*   **Outcome:** **Resolved!** ✅
    *   Testing adding a scene now results in the backend API (`/api/v1/media/store`) returning the correct `storageKey` (e.g., `proj_..._video.tmp`) and the corresponding public `url` based on that key.
    *   The frontend receives this correct data.
    *   The video player now correctly loads the media from the R2 URL without 404 errors.
*   **Conclusion:** The core issue of media failing to store or display after adding a scene is resolved. The problem stemmed from a cascade of issues: missing `projectId` in frontend effects, invalid hook calls, missing backend environment variables, and finally, inconsistent storage key usage in the backend API response.

## Final Fix Summary & Explanation

### The Problem (Simplified)

Imagine sending a package (your video/image file) to a big warehouse (Cloudflare R2). You need to tell the warehouse exactly which shelf to put it on (the `storageKey`), and you need the warehouse to give you back a claim ticket (the public `url`) so you can find it again later.

Our application was running into several issues:
1.  **Lost Instructions (Frontend Timing):** When a new scene arrived, the part of the app responsible for telling the warehouse to store the media (`SceneComponent`) sometimes tried to act too quickly, before it even knew *which project* the scene belonged to (`projectId` was missing).
2.  **Missing Address (Backend Config):** The backend (warehouse manager) didn't know the public address of the warehouse (`R2_PUBLIC_DOMAIN` environment variable wasn't being read) to write on the claim ticket.
3.  **Wrong Claim Ticket (Backend Logic):** Even when the backend *did* store the package, it accidentally wrote the *old* temporary tracking number (e.g., `timestamp.tmp`) on the claim ticket (`url`) instead of the *final* shelf location (`proj_..._video.mp4`).
4.  **Missing Tool (Backend Code):** At one point, the backend completely lost the tool (`generate_storage_key` function) it needed to figure out the shelf location.

### The Fix (Key Steps)

We tackled these issues step-by-step:

1.  **Frontend Patience:** Adjusted the `SceneComponent` (`useEffect` hook) to wait until it definitely had the `projectId` before trying to trigger the storage process. We also ensured hooks weren't called incorrectly (Attempt 7).
2.  **Backend Address Found:** Ensured the backend configuration (`config.py`) could read the warehouse address (`R2_PUBLIC_DOMAIN`) and fixed the Docker setup (`docker-compose.yml`) so the running container actually received this address from the environment variables (Attempts 9-13).
3.  **Correct Claim Ticket Issued:** Fixed the backend logic (`media_service.py`) to use the *correct final shelf location* (`actual_storage_key`) when creating the claim ticket (`url`) and when telling the frontend where the package ended up (Attempts 15-16).
4.  **Rebuilt Backend Tool:** Re-created the missing `generate_storage_key` function in a new utility file (`storage_utils.py`) so the backend could determine the correct shelf location again (Attempt 17).

### Outcome

Now, when a new scene is added:
*   The frontend waits until it has all necessary info (`projectId`).
*   It correctly tells the backend to store the media.
*   The backend uses the right tool to determine the storage key (shelf location).
*   It stores the file correctly in R2 (the warehouse).
*   It knows the warehouse's public address.
*   It returns the *correct* storage key and the *correct* public URL (claim ticket) to the frontend.
*   The frontend updates its records and can now display the media directly from R2.
