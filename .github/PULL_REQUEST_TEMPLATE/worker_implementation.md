# Cloudflare Worker for R2 Deletion Implementation

## Overview
This PR implements a Cloudflare Worker-based approach for R2 file deletion, providing a more reliable and architecturally sound solution.

## Changes Made
- Added Cloudflare Worker code for R2 deletion
- Created Python client for Worker interaction
- Updated storage service with Worker-based deletion method
- Added fallback mechanisms for reliable operation
- Created comprehensive debug endpoints for testing
- Added configuration options in settings
- Updated documentation

## How to Test
1. Deploy the Worker using instructions in `docs/Worker-Implementation-Guide.md`
2. Configure the Worker URL and API token in `.env`
3. Use debug endpoints to test Worker functionality:
   ```
   GET http://localhost:8000/api/v1/debug/worker-status
   POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/debug/test-worker
   POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/debug/cleanup-project/{project_id}?mode=worker&dry_run=true
   ```
4. Delete a project through the UI with `USE_WORKER_FOR_DELETION=true`

## Checklist
- [ ] Worker successfully deployed
- [ ] Worker binding configured in Cloudflare dashboard
- [ ] Worker tested with debug endpoints
- [ ] Fallback mechanisms verified
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] End-to-end testing completed

## Additional Notes
This implementation keeps the existing Wrangler-based approach as a fallback, ensuring robustness even if the Worker approach encounters issues.
