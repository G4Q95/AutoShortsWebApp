# Playwright Test Status (Updated March 15, 2025)

## Overview
This document tracks the status of our Playwright E2E test suite for the Auto Shorts Web App. It provides a comprehensive reference for the current state of tests, recent changes, and known issues.

## Test Suite Purpose

Our Playwright test suite is designed to verify the core functionality of the Auto Shorts Web App, including:

1. Home page navigation and basic UI elements
2. Project creation and management
3. Scene addition from Reddit URLs
4. Content extraction and media display
5. Scene reordering via drag-and-drop
6. Scene deletion
7. Audio generation and playback

The primary goal of these tests is to provide a safety net during refactoring and feature development. As we plan to refactor portions of the codebase in upcoming sprints, these tests help ensure that existing functionality remains intact while we make architectural improvements.

## Test Structure

Tests are located in `web/frontend/tests/e2e/` with the main test file being `core-functionality.spec.ts`.

### Helper Functions

The test suite includes several helper functions to improve reliability:

- `waitForWorkspace` - Waits for the project workspace to load properly
- `findElementWithText` - Finds elements containing specific text
- `elementWithTextExists` - Checks if elements with specific text exist
- `waitForElementWithText` - Waits for elements with specific text to appear
- `closeVoiceSettingsIfOpen` - Utility to close voice settings panel if open 
- `waitForScenes` - Waits for scene elements with multiple selector strategies

## Current Status

- **Tests Passing**: 8/8
- **Tests Failing**: 0/8
- **Last Run Date**: March 21, 2025

All tests are currently passing successfully, including both the core functionality tests and the dedicated mock audio test. The entire test suite now supports mock audio mode by default to avoid consuming ElevenLabs API credits during routine testing, while still providing comprehensive coverage of the application's functionality. This provides us with a solid baseline for the incremental component extraction approach we're adopting for refactoring.

## Mock Audio Testing

To address the challenge of consuming API credits during testing, we've implemented a comprehensive mock audio testing system:

### Mock Implementation Features

- **Environment Variable Control**: Tests can be run with `NEXT_PUBLIC_MOCK_AUDIO=true` to enable mock mode
- **Window Flag Detection**: Implementation checks for both environment variables and `window.USE_MOCK_AUDIO`
- **API Interception**: Tests can still verify API calls are made without actually calling ElevenLabs
- **Realistic Responses**: Mock system returns properly structured responses matching the real API format
- **Test Compatibility**: All existing tests work with mock audio mode with no modifications
- **Console Logging**: Enhanced logging indicates when mock mode is active and which source triggered it
- **Delay Simulation**: Realistic delays simulate actual API response times

### How Mock Audio Works

1. When a test runs with mock audio enabled, the `generateVoice` function detects this mode
2. A network request is still made to trigger test interception but doesn't reach ElevenLabs 
3. The test intercepts the request using Playwright's route interception
4. A mock response with base64 audio data is returned
5. The audio playback UI behaves exactly as it would with real API data
6. No ElevenLabs API credits are consumed

### When to Use Mock vs. Real API Testing

- **Use Mock Audio (Default)**: For regular development, CI/CD pipelines, and routine testing
- **Use Real API**: Only when specifically testing the ElevenLabs integration or when verifying actual audio quality

## Known Issues

### 1. Scene Deletion Challenges

**Symptoms:**
- Scene deletion test shows warnings about difficulty finding delete buttons
- Test uses fallback to positional clicks when standard selectors fail
- Test ultimately completes successfully but with bypassed strict verification

**What We've Tried:**
- Multiple selector strategies for delete buttons
- Scanning for SVG elements within buttons
- Positional clicking as a fallback mechanism

**Current Status:**
- Test passes successfully but relies on fallback mechanisms
- The scene deletion functionality could be made more testable with improved data-testid attributes

### 2. Backend Errors During Video Processing

**Symptoms:**
- Console shows errors related to video processing:
  ```
  Error starting fast video processing: SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'I', "Internal S"... is not valid JSON
  Error processing video: SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'I', "Internal S"... is not valid JSON
  ```
- These errors don't impact test results but indicate potential backend issues

**Current Status:**
- Tests complete successfully despite these errors
- Backend video processing functionality may need investigation

### 3. TypeScript Linter Errors

**Symptoms:**
- "Property 'toBe' does not exist on type 'never'" error for the `elevenlabsApiCalled` variable
- Type annotations needed for proper Playwright test functions

**Current Status:**
- Tests execute successfully despite linter warnings
- Type annotations should be addressed for code quality

## Environment Setup

### Docker Environment

Tests are designed to run within our Docker development environment:

```bash
# Start Docker containers
docker-compose up -d

# Run tests
cd web/frontend && npm test
```

### Required Services

All these services must be running for tests to pass:
- Frontend (Next.js) - Port 3000
- Backend (FastAPI) - Port 8000
- Browser-tools-server - Port 3025
- MongoDB Atlas connectivity
- Cloudflare R2 integration (for saved assets)

## Test Execution

### Running Tests

```bash
# From the project root (uses mock audio by default)
cd web/frontend && npm test

# To run with mock audio explicitly enabled
cd web/frontend && NEXT_PUBLIC_MOCK_AUDIO=true npm test

# To run with real ElevenLabs API calls (consumes API credits)
cd web/frontend && NEXT_PUBLIC_MOCK_AUDIO=false npm test

# To run a specific test file with mock audio
cd web/frontend && NEXT_PUBLIC_MOCK_AUDIO=true npx playwright test core-functionality.spec.ts

# To run the dedicated mock audio test
cd web/frontend && npx playwright test mock-audio-test.spec.ts

# To run in debug mode
cd web/frontend && PWDEBUG=1 npm run test:debug

# To run a specific test by name
cd web/frontend && npx playwright test --grep "Existing project functionality"
```

### Default Behavior

By default, all test commands use mock audio mode to avoid consuming ElevenLabs API credits. This behavior is:
- Controlled by the NEXT_PUBLIC_MOCK_AUDIO environment variable
- Set to 'true' in the package.json test scripts
- Can be overridden for specific test runs as shown above

## Conclusion

The Playwright test suite is now fully stable with all 7 tests passing successfully. The tests verify all core functionality of the application and are integrated with our Docker environment. 

With the implementation of the mock audio testing system, we've significantly improved our testing infrastructure:
- **Cost Efficiency**: Tests no longer consume ElevenLabs API credits during routine testing
- **Faster Execution**: Mock responses are faster than waiting for real API calls
- **Consistent Results**: Tests produce the same results regardless of API connectivity
- **CI/CD Friendly**: Tests can be run in automation pipelines without API key configuration
- **Developer Experience**: Local development testing is simplified with no need for API credentials

These improvements provide a solid foundation for upcoming refactoring work, ensuring we don't break existing functionality while improving the codebase architecture. The mock audio system allows us to comprehensively test audio-related features without worrying about API rate limits or costs, while still maintaining the ability to test with real API integration when needed.
