# Test Efficiency Guide

This document outlines strategies for improving the efficiency and maintainability of our Playwright end-to-end tests for the Auto Shorts Web App.

## Current Challenges

Our end-to-end tests have been encountering several challenges:

1. **Selector Brittleness**: CSS classes and DOM structure changes often break tests
2. **Maintenance Overhead**: Changes to UI components require updating selectors in multiple test files
3. **Test Reliability**: Inconsistent timing and race conditions cause flaky tests
4. **API Credit Consumption**: Running tests with real ElevenLabs API calls consumes credits
5. **Poor Reusability**: Common testing patterns are duplicated across test files

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Centralized Selectors Library

We've created a centralized selectors library in `web/frontend/tests/e2e/utils/selectors.ts` that:

- Defines all selectors in one place for easy maintenance
- Uses fallback strategies with multiple selector alternatives
- Provides helper functions for resilient element selection

Example:
```typescript
// selectors.ts
export const selectors = {
  // Navigation
  createVideoButton: 'a:has-text("Create Video")',
  myProjectsLink: 'a:has-text("My Projects")',
  
  // Project Creation
  projectNameInput: '[placeholder="Enter project name"]',
  createProjectButton: 'button:has-text("Create Project")',
  
  // Workspace
  projectWorkspace: '.project-workspace, .workspace-container',
  urlInput: 'input[placeholder*="Reddit URL"], input[placeholder*="URL"]',
  addContentButton: 'button:has-text("Add")',
  
  // Scenes
  sceneComponent: '[data-testid^="scene-number-"]',
  sceneContainer: '.scene-container',
  
  // Voice Generation
  generateVoiceButton: 'button:has-text("Generate Voiceover")',
  generateVoiceButtonFallbacks: [
    'text=Generate Voiceover',
    'button:has-text("Generate Voiceover")',
    '[aria-label*="generate voice"]',
    '[class*="voice-button"]'
  ],
  
  // Scene Deletion
  sceneDeleteButton: '[data-testid="delete-scene-button"]',
  sceneDeleteButtonFallbacks: [
    '[data-testid="delete-scene-button"]',
    'button[aria-label="Remove scene"]',
    'button:has(svg[class*="trash"])',
    '.bg-red-600'
  ]
};
```

### Import Structure Best Practices

We've implemented a clear import structure to prevent common issues:

- **Root selectors**: Global selectors are in `tests/selectors.ts`
- **Util selectors**: Reusable selectors are in `tests/e2e/utils/selectors.ts`
- **Test utilities**: Common functions and constants are in `tests/e2e/utils/test-utils.ts`

This separation prevents duplicate imports and circular dependencies that were causing test failures.

Important guidelines to follow:
- Never import the same constants twice in a file
- Use named imports to clearly indicate what's being imported
- When using both global and util selectors, use namespacing:
  ```typescript
  import { DRAG_HANDLE_SELECTOR } from '../selectors';
  import { selectors, clickWithFallbacks } from './utils/selectors';
  ```

### 2. Reusable Test Utilities

We've created common test utilities in `web/frontend/tests/e2e/utils/test-utils.ts` to:

- Reduce code duplication across test files
- Encapsulate complex testing logic
- Provide consistent patterns for testing common functionality

Example:
```typescript
// test-utils.ts
export async function createTestProject(page, projectName?) {
  const name = projectName || `Test Project ${Date.now()}`;
  
  // Navigate to home page
  await goToHomePage(page);
  
  // Click create video button
  await page.click(selectors.createVideoButton);
  
  // Fill project name and create
  await page.fill(selectors.projectNameInput, name);
  await page.click(selectors.createProjectButton);
  
  // Wait for workspace to load
  await waitForProjectWorkspace(page);
  
  return name;
}
```

### 3. Mock Audio Testing

We've implemented a robust mock audio testing system that:

- Avoids consuming ElevenLabs API credits
- Provides realistic simulation of the audio generation process
- Uses environment variables to control test behavior
- Is compatible with both mock and real API modes

Mock audio is enabled via:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_MOCK_AUDIO=true` environment variable
- `window.USE_MOCK_AUDIO` browser flag

### 4. Enhanced Test Scripts

We've updated package.json to provide clear test commands:

```json
"scripts": {
  "test": "NEXT_PUBLIC_TESTING_MODE=true NEXT_PUBLIC_MOCK_AUDIO=true playwright test",
  "test:mock": "NEXT_PUBLIC_TESTING_MODE=true NEXT_PUBLIC_MOCK_AUDIO=true playwright test",
  "test:real": "NEXT_PUBLIC_TESTING_MODE=true NEXT_PUBLIC_MOCK_AUDIO=false playwright test",
  "test:mock-audio": "NEXT_PUBLIC_TESTING_MODE=true NEXT_PUBLIC_MOCK_AUDIO=true playwright test tests/e2e/mock-audio-test.spec.ts",
  "test:core": "NEXT_PUBLIC_TESTING_MODE=true NEXT_PUBLIC_MOCK_AUDIO=true playwright test tests/e2e/core-functionality.spec.ts"
}
```

### 5. Test Tagging

We've implemented test tagging through descriptive test names to allow for selective test running:

```typescript
test('Audio generation with mock API', async ({ page }) => {
  // Test code for mock audio
});

// Run with: npx playwright test --grep "Audio"
```

### 6. Reliable Scene Deletion Testing

We've implemented a more robust approach to testing scene deletion:

- Fixed the data-testid attribute in selectors.ts to match implementation
- Used specific targeting of '[data-testid="delete-scene-button"]'
- Improved verification strategy by checking scene count changes
- Added fallback strategies with proper validation
- Enhanced error reporting and diagnostics
- Added screenshot capture at key testing points

## Best Practices for Resilient Selectors

1. **Prioritize data-testid attributes**:
   ```html
   <button data-testid="generate-voice-button">Generate Voiceover</button>
   ```
   ```typescript
   await page.click('[data-testid="generate-voice-button"]');
   ```

2. **Use text content as a reliable fallback**:
   ```typescript
   await page.click('button:has-text("Generate Voiceover")');
   ```

3. **Use multiple selector strategies with fallbacks**:
   ```typescript
   await clickWithFallbacks(page, [
     '[data-testid="generate-voice-button"]',
     'button:has-text("Generate Voiceover")',
     '[aria-label="Generate voice"]'
   ]);
   ```

4. **Avoid relying on CSS classes that may change**:
   - ❌ `.btn-blue-generate`
   - ✅ `button[aria-label="Generate"]`

5. **Use composite selectors for specific elements**:
   ```typescript
   // Target a button within a specific container
   await page.click('.scene-container:nth-child(2) [data-testid="generate-button"]');
   ```

## Guidelines for Modular Test Organization

1. **One test file per feature area**:
   - `core-functionality.spec.ts`
   - `audio-generation.spec.ts`
   - `project-management.spec.ts`

2. **Use descriptive test names**:
   ```typescript
   test('User can create a new project and add scenes', async ({ page }) => {
     // Test code
   });
   ```

3. **Group related tests with describe blocks**:
   ```typescript
   describe('Project Management', () => {
     test('User can create a new project', async ({ page }) => {
       // Test code
     });
     
     test('User can delete a project', async ({ page }) => {
       // Test code
     });
   });
   ```

4. **Extract setup and teardown logic**:
   ```typescript
   // In test-utils.ts
   export async function setupTestProject(page) {
     // Common setup code
   }
   
   // In the test
   test('Project functionality', async ({ page }) => {
     await setupTestProject(page);
     // Test specific code
     await cleanupTestProject(page);
   });
   ```

## Quick Wins for Improving Test Efficiency

1. **Add data-testid attributes to key UI components**:
   - Add to all buttons, forms, inputs, and interactive elements
   - Follow a consistent naming convention

2. **Break down large test files**:
   - Split core-functionality.spec.ts (1100+ lines) into domain-specific files
   - Create separate files for project, scene, and voice testing

3. **Add more descriptive logger statements**:
   - Log the current stage of the test
   - Log important state changes
   - Include screenshots at critical points

4. **Add tag-based comments for selective test running**:
   - `// @tag: audio` 
   - `// @tag: project`
   - `// @tag: regression`

## Refactoring Workflow Best Practices

To ensure successful test refactoring and prevent breaking existing tests, follow these guidelines:

### Testing Frequency
- **Test after each helper function creation** - Never implement more than one helper before testing
- **Test after each file split** - When splitting files, test immediately after moving each test case
- **Maximum 5-minute coding intervals** - Stop and test at least every 5 minutes regardless of progress
- **Verify before/after each rename** - Run tests immediately before and after renaming any selector or function

### Accuracy Improvement Plan
1. **Copy-Paste-Verify Pattern**:
   - Copy original code to a comment first
   - Implement refactored version
   - Compare side-by-side before removing original
   - Run tests before removing the comment

2. **Systematic Verification**:
   - Use search functionality to find all instances of selectors/functions being modified
   - Create a checklist of all locations that need updates
   - Check off each location after updating

3. **Incremental Implementation**:
   - Introduce new helpers alongside existing code first
   - Don't delete original implementations until new helpers are proven working
   - Deprecate old patterns gradually, not all at once

4. **Reference Variable Pattern**:
   - Create reference variables for any reused values to avoid typos
   - Use constants for selector strings to ensure consistency

### Progress Tracking During Refactoring
- Keep a checklist of tests that pass with current implementation
- After each change, verify the same tests still pass
- Maintain a running log of which tests are passing/failing

### Step-by-Step Execution Plan
1. Create single helper function → Test
2. Move one test case to new file → Test
3. Update imported helpers → Test
4. Repeat for next function/test case

By strictly adhering to this strategy, we'll catch issues immediately after they're introduced rather than having to debug multiple changes at once.

## Scene Deletion Test Improvements

The scene deletion test was previously failing or relying on fallback mechanisms because:

1. There was a mismatch between the selector in selectors.ts (`scene-delete-button`) and the actual DOM attribute (`delete-scene-button`)
2. The verification was using a general blue element selector which matched other UI components
3. The fallback mechanisms weren't properly validating successful deletion

We implemented the following fixes:

1. Updated selectors.ts to use the correct data-testid: `[data-testid="delete-scene-button"]`
2. Improved the verification strategy to check scene count changes instead of element visibility
3. Added proper scene component targeting with `[data-testid="scene-component"]` 
4. Enhanced error reporting with detailed logging at each step
5. Structured fallbacks from specific to general with proper validation
6. Added screenshot capture at key testing points for diagnostics

These changes have improved test reliability, ensuring that we properly test the scene deletion functionality without relying on fragile selectors or positional clicking.

## Implementation Plan

1. Complete migration of remaining test code to the new file structure
2. Create domain-specific test utility files (project-utils.ts, scene-utils.ts, etc.)
3. Refactor tests to use these utilities to reduce duplication
4. Add visual comparison testing for critical UI components
