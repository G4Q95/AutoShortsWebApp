# AUTO SHORTS WEB APP - PROJECT OVERVIEW

## Core Concept
A web application that allows users to convert social media content (primarily from Reddit) into engaging short-form videos by:
1. Retrieving content from URLs
2. Rewriting text using AI
3. Generating voiceovers
4. Assembling videos with the content and voiceover

## Enhanced Video Project Experience (New)
The application will feature an intuitive video project creation workflow:
1. Users enter a project title to create a new video project
2. Within the project workspace, users can add Reddit URLs (and later other sources)
3. Each URL becomes a "scene" displaying:
   - The extracted media (image/video) from the URL
   - The accompanying text content below the media
4. Scenes can be dragged and reordered to determine the final video sequence
5. Users can edit text content and customize each scene
6. The entire project can be processed into a seamless short-form video

## Business Model
- **Freemium approach** with tiered access:
  - Free tier with limited features and usage caps
  - Premium tier ($15/month) with expanded features and higher limits
  - Pro tier ($30/month) with unlimited access and priority processing

## Key Technical Decisions

### Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) Architecture
- All infrastructure components use PAYG pricing models
- No fixed monthly costs for idle resources
- Services scale up and down with actual usage
- Cost-efficient for early stages with few users

### API Costs Management
- OpenAI API costs approximately $0.001-0.002 per post with GPT-3.5
- ElevenLabs costs approximately $0.014-0.027 per video (standard voices)
- Implementation of caching strategies to reduce duplicate API calls
- Hard caps per user to prevent cost overruns

### A Possible Cost Breakdown for 1,000 Active Free Users
- OpenAI API (GPT-3.5): $10-20/month
- ElevenLabs: $70-140/month
- Google Cloud Run: $10-30/month
- Cloudflare R2: $2.50/month
- MongoDB Atlas: $0/month (free tier)
- Vercel: $0/month (free tier)
- **Total**: $92.50-192.50/month

### Technology Selection Rationale

#### Frontend: Next.js with React
- Best for media-heavy applications
- SEO benefits for attracting users
- Excellent developer experience
- Scales well with Vercel hosting
- React DnD or react-beautiful-dnd for drag-and-drop scene ordering

#### Backend: FastAPI (Python)
- Reuse existing Python code from legacy scripts
- High performance for concurrent requests
- Automatic API documentation
- Well-suited for asynchronous operations
- **Architecture Update**: Implemented Celery with a Redis broker for handling background tasks (e.g., media downloads) asynchronously, improving responsiveness and robustness.

#### Database: MongoDB Atlas
- Free tier to start
- Flexible schema for varied content types
- PAYG scaling beyond free tier
- Good Python integration

#### Storage: Cloudflare R2
- No egress fees (critical for video delivery)
- S3-compatible API
- Pay only for what you store
- Global distribution network

#### Video Editing: Core Architecture
- **Preview & UI:** Utilize the `video-context` library in the frontend (React) for:
  - Real-time visual preview of scenes and sequence.
  - Interactive trimming controls.
  - Management of the editing timeline UI.
- **Edit Definition:** User interactions (trims, scene order, audio settings) generate a JSON-based Edit Decision List (EDL).
- **Final Rendering:** Use server-side FFmpeg (integrated with the FastAPI backend) to process the EDL:
  - Fetches original media from R2 based on EDL.
  - Performs precise cuts, audio mixing, and scene concatenation.
  - Produces the final downloadable video file.

#### Media Processing: Google Cloud Run
- **Architecture Update**: Media downloading is now handled by `yt-dlp` running within a Celery worker task. FFmpeg operations are containerized in a dedicated `ffmpeg-service` Docker container.
- Container-based for FFMPEG integration
- No minimum instances (scales to zero)
- No time limits for video processing
- Better free tier than alternatives

#### Hosting: Vercel
- Optimized for Next.js
- Global CDN included
- Free tier sufficient for early stage
- Seamless integration with GitHub

  1. Foundation Building (Weeks 1-3)
  2. Web Application Development (Weeks 4-6)
  3. Processing Pipeline & Storage Optimization (Weeks 7-8)

### Technical Decisions & Rationale

*   **Frontend Framework**: Next.js with React chosen for its robust ecosystem, SSR/SSG capabilities, and component-based architecture suitable for complex UIs.
*   **Backend Framework**: FastAPI (Python) selected for its high performance, async capabilities (crucial for I/O-bound tasks like external API calls and media processing), and automatic OpenAPI documentation.
*   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling, enabling rapid UI development and consistency.
*   **Database**: MongoDB Atlas (NoSQL) for flexible data schemas, scalability, and cloud hosting convenience.
*   **Media Storage**: Cloudflare R2 for S3-compatible object storage, offering potentially lower egress costs.
*   **Video Preview Engine**: `video-context` library chosen initially for its WebGL-based timeline compositing features. **Update (July 2024):** Adopting a hybrid approach where `video-context` handles core playback/timing, while complex UI elements like captions are rendered using synchronized HTML/CSS overlays managed by React. This leverages the strengths of both technologies.
*   **Video Export Processing**: FFmpeg (executed on the backend) chosen as the industry standard for robust video manipulation, trimming, effect application, and final encoding.
*   **Containerization**: Docker and Docker Compose for consistent development, testing, and deployment environments.
*   **Deployment**: Google Cloud Run (backend) and Vercel (frontend) for scalable, managed hosting solutions.
