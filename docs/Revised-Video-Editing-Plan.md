Auto Shorts Web App: Revised Video Editor Implementation Plan
1. Overview
This revised implementation plan focuses on integrating established video editing libraries into the Auto Shorts Web App rather than building a custom editor from scratch. This approach dramatically reduces development time and potential bugs while still providing the functionality needed for creating short-form videos from social media content.
2. Hybrid Architecture Strategy
Core Architecture
The revised architecture leverages existing libraries while maintaining the same overall structure:
Frontend: React-based UI using an established video editing library
Backend: FastAPI with FFmpeg for processing
Storage: Cloudflare R2 for media assets
Integration Layer: Custom code to connect existing app with video editing components
Key Principles
Leverage Don't Build: Use established libraries for the complex parts
Focus on Integration: Direct development effort to connecting systems
Preserve Existing Workflow: Maintain compatibility with current scene management
Progressive Enhancement: Start with core functionality, add advanced features later
3. Primary Implementation Options
After evaluating available libraries, here are three viable approaches ranked by suitability:

Maintain Incremental Approach: Build features progressively, starting with core functionality
Focus on Integration: Direct development effort toward smooth integration with existing components
Preserve User Experience: Ensure the new editor feels like a natural extension of the current app
Collect Early Feedback: Get user input on the editor experience as soon as a basic version is available
By following this approach, the Auto Shorts Web App can quickly add powerful video editing capabilities while avoiding the pitfalls of building complex video processing from scratch.






















Understanding the Video Processing Pipeline Implementation: 

From Basic to AdvancedI understand your confusion. Let me break down exactly what the video processing pipeline stages would look like from a user perspective, and how we can implement them incrementally without waiting for a full-featured video editor.
Current State (0% Video Processing)
Right now, your app allows:
Content extraction from URLs
Scene organization with drag-and-drop
Basic text editing
Project saving/loading
But there's no actual video generation or editing capability yet.
Stage 1: Basic FFmpeg Video Assembly (40-50% Complete)
What it would look like for users:
A simple "Generate Video" button at the bottom of the project workspace
When clicked, it processes the scenes in their current order
Each scene becomes a simple video segment (fixed duration for images)
Basic transitions between scenes (simple fades)
A loading indicator shows processing status
When complete, users can download the final video
No timeline interface yet - just the existing scene grid
Backend work:
Basic FFmpeg commands to convert images/videos to segments
Simple concatenation of segments with basic transitions
Video rendering with text overlays
Upload to Cloudflare R2 for storage
Return video URL to frontend
This is the "40% complete" milestone - some of this backend work has started but isn't yet connected to the frontend.
Stage 2: Enhanced Video Generation (60-70%)
What it would look like for users:
Same interface as Stage 1, but with:
Duration controls for each scene (simple input fields)
Basic text positioning options
Transition type selection (fade, wipe, etc.)
Export quality options (resolution, format)
Processing progress indicators with percent complete
Still no timeline editor - just enhanced scene controls
Backend work:
More sophisticated FFmpeg commands
Support for different transition types
Variable duration handling
Text positioning and styling
Enhanced error handling and recovery
Stage 3: Basic Timeline Preview (80-85%)
What it would look like for users:
A new "Timeline View" tab in the project workspace
Simple horizontal timeline showing scene sequence
Basic scrubbing to preview content at different points
Scene duration shown visually as width
Transition indicators between scenes
Video export from this view
Not yet fully interactive for editing
Backend/Frontend work:
Integration of a basic video preview system (HTML5 video)
Non-interactive timeline visualization
Enhanced metadata for scene timing
Video preview generation at lower resolution
This could use basic HTML/CSS without a specific library yet
Stage 4: Full Video Editor Integration (100%)
What it would look like for users:
Complete timeline editor (using VideoContext or similar)
Interactive drag handles for scene duration
Real-time preview as changes are made
Effect controls for each scene
Advanced text positioning and animation
Multiple tracks for overlays
Export with various quality options
Backend/Frontend work:
Full integration of VideoContext or chosen library
Real-time preview rendering
Complex FFmpeg command generation
Advanced effect processing
Enhanced storage and caching
Why This Incremental Approach Makes Sense
Value Delivery: Users get video generation capability much sooner (Stage 1)
Feedback Collection: You can learn what users actually need before building the complex editor
Risk Reduction: The backend FFmpeg integration is validated before investing in complex UI
Technical Foundation: The core video processing pipeline is needed regardless of which editor UI you choose
Parallel Development: You can enhance content sources while working on the video pipeline
Example Timeline and User Experience
Month 1: Basic Video Generation (Stage 1)
User uploads Reddit links
Arranges scenes in desired order
Clicks "Generate Video" button
Waits for processing (1-3 minutes)
Downloads completed video with basic transitions
Simple and functional, even without a timeline editor
Month 2: Enhanced Controls (Stage 2)
Same flow, but user can now:
Set specific durations for each scene
Choose transition types
Position text more precisely
Select video quality
Still using the existing scene grid layout
Month 3: Timeline Preview (Stage 3)
User can switch to "Timeline View"
See visual representation of video
Scrub through to preview at different points
Export with all previous options
Get a better sense of final video timing
Month 4: Full Editor (Stage 4)
Complete timeline editing experience
Real-time preview and adjustments
Advanced effects and transitions
Multiple tracks if needed
All the capabilities we discussed with VideoContext
Does this clarify how the implementation would progress? The key is that users get valuable video generation capabilities long before the full editor is implemented, while we build toward the more sophisticated timeline-based editing experience.
