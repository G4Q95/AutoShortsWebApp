# Video Integration - Part 1: Preview Playback

> **IMPORTANT UPDATE**: This document describes our initial custom implementation approach for video preview and playback. Due to persistent issues with custom timeline scrubber implementation, we have pivoted to using BBC's VideoContext library for a more robust solution. Please refer to [Video-Integration-Part2.md](./Video-Integration-Part2.md) for our current implementation plan.

## Overview

This document outlines the first phase of the video processing pipeline implementation, focusing on the preview playback functionality. This feature will allow users to preview scenes individually or all scenes sequentially, with proper synchronization between media (images/videos) and generated voiceovers.

## Current Status

- âœ… Voice generation is fully functional with ElevenLabs integration
- âœ… Audio files are being stored in Cloudflare R2
- âœ… Scene management with drag-and-drop reordering is complete
- âœ… ScenePreviewPlayer component implemented
- âœ… Media display with adaptive aspect ratio detection implemented
- âœ… Compact and expanded view modes for scenes implemented
- âœ… Collapsible information display with space optimization implemented
- âœ… TrimControls component implemented
- âœ… Playwright testing configuration updated for headless mode
- âœ… Media files (Reddit content) are now properly stored in Cloudflare R2
- ðŸ”„ Video processing pipeline is partially implemented (45%)

## Implementation Goals

1. **Media Storage**
   - âœ… Download and store Reddit media content in Cloudflare R2
   - âœ… Implement proper pairing between media files and generated audio
   - âœ… Create organized storage structure in R2

2. **Preview Playback**
   - âœ… Create individual scene previews with synchronized audio
   - âœ… Add view mode toggle for compact and expanded displays
   - âœ… Implement adaptive media sizing based on content aspect ratio
   - ðŸ”„ Implement sequential playback of all scenes
   - âœ… Add basic play/pause controls

   > **Implementation Note**: The main video player component is `ScenePreviewPlayer.tsx` located in `web/frontend/src/components/preview/`. This component handles media playback, timeline scrubbing, and trim controls. When making modifications to video playback functionality, this is the primary component to update.
   >
   > **Component Clarification**: There are two separate timeline scrubber implementations in the codebase:
   > 1. `ScenePreviewPlayer.tsx` in `components/preview/` - This is the **active** video player used in the scene card UI
   > 2. `SceneTrimControls.tsx` in `components/scene/` - This is a standalone trim controls component that's currently not being actively used
   >
   > When making changes to the video player functionality, always check which component is actually being rendered in the DOM by inspecting the element and looking for data-testid attributes like "position-indicator" and "hover-seek-slider".

3. **Media Trimming**
   - âœ… Add ability to trim the beginning and end of media
   - ðŸ”„ Set appropriate default durations:
     - ðŸ”„ Photos: Length of the generated voiceover
     - ðŸ”„ Videos: Original video length with voiceover at the beginning

## Testing Plan

To ensure the quality and reliability of the video integration features, we have established a comprehensive testing plan:

### Test Execution Environment

- All tests run in headless mode by default
- Debug mode only used with explicit `--debug` flag
- Video recordings enabled for failed tests
- Automatic screenshots on failures

### Media Storage Testing

- Monitor network requests for media uploads
- Verify successful storage in R2
- Check response status codes and payloads
- Validate media metadata and storage keys

### Preview Playback Testing

- Test media synchronization
- Verify trim controls functionality
- Check loading states and error handling
- Test different media types (image, video, gallery)

### Test Command Reference

```bash
# Run all tests in headless mode
npm test

# Run tests with debug mode (manual intervention)
npm run test:debug

# Run tests with mock audio
NEXT_PUBLIC_MOCK_AUDIO=true npm test

# Run tests with real API calls
NEXT_PUBLIC_MOCK_AUDIO=false npm test
```

## FFMPEG Integration

For the backend video processing, we'll use FFMPEG:

1. **Basic Implementation**
   - Set up FFMPEG in Docker container for development
   - Create basic command wrappers for common operations
   - Test with sample media for processing capability

2. **Video Processing Service**
   - Create backend endpoints for video operations
   - Implement progress tracking and status updates
   - Configure proper error handling and logging

## Alternative Considerations

### BBC VideoContext Option

As noted in the project documentation, BBC's VideoContext library provides an alternative implementation approach:

- **Potential Benefits**:
  - Professional-grade compositing with WebGL acceleration
  - Real-time preview of effects and transitions
  - Pre-built timeline functionality
  - Open-source with no licensing costs

- **Implementation Requirements**:
  - React wrapper components for VideoContext
  - Custom timeline UI mapped to VideoContext nodes
  - Backend integration to convert timeline data to FFmpeg commands

### Decision Factors

For the initial implementation (Part 1), we'll proceed with the direct FFMPEG approach for simplicity, but will:
- Prototype minimal BBC VideoContext implementation to evaluate potential benefits
- Compare performance and development effort between approaches
- Make final architecture decision based on prototype results
