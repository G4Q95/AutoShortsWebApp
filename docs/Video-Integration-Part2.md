# VideoContext Integration for Auto Shorts Web App

## Overview

The VideoContext library offers professional-grade WebGL accelerated video composition capabilities. This integration provides:

- Sophisticated video composition with WebGL acceleration
- Support for complex transitions and effects
- Built-in timeline functionality for precise control
- Open-source library with good documentation

## Library Evaluation

We evaluated several options for timeline-based video editing:

1. **VideoContext** (chosen solution)
   - Pros: WebGL acceleration, rich effects API, precise timing control
   - Cons: Requires more setup than simpler libraries

2. **react-timeline-editor**
   - Pros: React-focused, simpler API
   - Cons: Less powerful, fewer features for video manipulation

3. **Remotion**
   - Pros: React-based video creation framework
   - Cons: Heavier dependency, focused on rendering rather than editing

VideoContext provides the best balance of performance and flexibility for our needs.

## Code Organization Principles

To maintain clean, maintainable code:

- Keep modules under 300 lines of code where possible
- Extract reusable functions into utility files
- Maintain clear separation of concerns
- Follow consistent naming conventions with "VideoContext" prefix
- Document interfaces and major functions

## Implementation Progress

### Phase 1: Basic Integration (Completed)

Core components implemented:
- `VideoContextManager` utility class
- `VideoContextProvider` context provider
- `VideoContextPreview` for media display
- `VideoContextTimeline` for scene timeline
- `VideoContextEditor` for the overall editing interface

Functionality completed:
- Canvas rendering of media sources
- Basic playback controls (play, pause, seek)
- Timeline visualization with proper durations
- Scene selection and management
- Simple transitions between scenes

Pending tasks:
- Refine timeline UI with more precise controls
- Implement visual effects library
- Connect with scene generation workflow
- Add export functionality

### Roadmap for Future Phases

Phase 2: Advanced Features
- Enhanced timeline UI with draggable scenes
- Visual effects library integration
- Text overlay capabilities
- Advanced transitions

Phase 3: Export Integration
- Connect to backend for final video processing
- Add quality/format selection
- Implement progress tracking for exports

## Component Breakdown

### Core Components

| Component | Responsibility | File Path |
|-----------|----------------|-----------|
| `VideoContextManager` | Low-level VideoContext API wrapper | `/src/utils/video/videoContextManager.js` |
| `VideoContextProvider` | Context provider for VideoContext state | `/src/contexts/VideoContextProvider.tsx` |

### UI Components

| Component | Responsibility | File Path |
|-----------|----------------|-----------|
| `VideoContextPreview` | Displays the video canvas with controls | `/src/components/video/VideoContextPreview.tsx` |
| `VideoContextTimeline` | Visualizes scenes on a timeline | `/src/components/video/VideoContextTimeline.tsx` |
| `VideoContextEditor` | Main editor component combining preview and timeline | `/src/components/video/VideoContextEditor.tsx` |

## Current Demo

A basic demo is available at `/videocontext-editor-demo` that showcases:
- Sample scenes (images and videos)
- Timeline visualization
- Playback controls
- Scene selection
- Duration adjustment

## Next Steps

1. Enhance the VideoContextTimeline UI:
   - Add draggable scene blocks
   - Implement zoom functionality
   - Add time markers

2. Implement visual effects:
   - Add filters (brightness, contrast, etc.)
   - Create transitions library
   - Support text overlays

3. Integrate with existing Scene component:
   - Connect to scene generation workflow
   - Support for auto-generated content

4. Connect to backend:
   - API for final video processing
   - Export quality options
   - Progress tracking
