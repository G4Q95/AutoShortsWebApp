# Cloudflare R2 Reconfig - Part 3

This document continues our work on fixing Cloudflare R2 storage cleanup issues, with a focus on synchronizing frontend project deletion with R2 file removal.

## Summary of Previous Findings (Part 2)

### Key Challenges Identified

1. **Inconsistent Storage Paths**: Files stored using multiple formats:
   - Hierarchical paths: `projects/proj_ID/scenes/SCENE_ID/media/filename.ext`
   - Flat paths with double prefixes: `proj_proj_{id}_{scene}_media.mp4`
   - Content-specific paths: `audio/proj_ID/SCENE_ID/filename.ext`

2. **Double Prefix Problem**: Files saved with `proj_proj_` prefix when project IDs already contained "proj_"

3. **R2 Directory Structure**: R2 doesn't use real folders, only keys with slashes

4. **Silent Failures**: Deletion operations failing without clear error messages

### Recent Breakthroughs

1. **The `--remote` Flag**: Critical discovery that all Wrangler CLI commands must use the `--remote` flag to affect the actual cloud bucket
   ```bash
   # This only affects the local simulator (NOT the actual cloud bucket):
   wrangler r2 object delete autoshorts-media/test.txt

   # This affects the actual cloud bucket:
   wrangler r2 object delete autoshorts-media/test.txt --remote
   ```

2. **Hybrid Approach**: Using S3 API for listing and filtering objects, combined with Wrangler CLI for reliable deletion

3. **Working Scripts**: Successfully created and tested scripts for manual R2 cleanup

### Current Status

Despite these advances, we're still encountering inconsistent results when deleting projects from the web application. Files are sometimes left behind in R2 even though deletion appears successful in the UI.

## Diagnostic Framework: Application vs Scripts

The core issue appears to be a discrepancy between manual script execution (which works) and application-triggered deletion (which sometimes fails). This suggests several potential problem areas:

### 1. Execution Context & Permissions

Manual scripts run in a different environment than the application, with potentially different:
- Authentication credentials
- Environment variables
- Path configurations
- Permission contexts

### 2. File Discovery Logic

The application's method for identifying files to delete might differ from our successful scripts:
- Pattern matching variations
- Pagination handling for large buckets
- Error handling differences

### 3. Deletion Process

How deletion commands are executed could vary:
- Parallel vs sequential execution
- Subprocess handling
- Error capturing and reporting

### 4. Application Flow & Background Tasks

The overall deletion flow might have weaknesses:
- Background task reliability
- Error propagation
- Completion verification

## Comprehensive Action Plan

We will implement a systematic approach to diagnose and resolve these issues:

### Phase 1: Execution Context Verification (Implemented)

1. **Authentication Verification**
   - Added a debug endpoint that runs `wrangler whoami` from the application context
   - Verifies that Wrangler is correctly authenticated within the application
   ```python
   @router.get("/debug/wrangler-auth", response_model=Dict[str, Any])
   async def verify_wrangler_auth():
       """Verify Wrangler authentication status from application context."""
       try:
           result = subprocess.run(["wrangler", "whoami"], capture_output=True, text=True)
           return {
               "stdout": result.stdout,
               "stderr": result.stderr,
               "exit_code": result.returncode,
               "is_authenticated": "You are logged in" in result.stdout
           }
       except Exception as e:
           logger.error(f"Error verifying Wrangler auth: {str(e)}")
           return {
               "error": str(e),
               "exit_code": -1,
               "is_authenticated": False
           }
   ```

2. **R2 Access Check**
   - Added a debug endpoint to list R2 buckets
   - Confirms application can access R2 using the same credentials as scripts
   ```python
   @router.get("/debug/r2-access", response_model=Dict[str, Any])
   async def verify_r2_access():
       """Verify R2 bucket access from application context."""
       try:
           result = subprocess.run(["wrangler", "r2", "bucket", "list", "--remote"], 
                               capture_output=True, text=True)
           return {
               "stdout": result.stdout,
               "stderr": result.stderr,
               "exit_code": result.returncode,
               "buckets": [line.strip() for line in result.stdout.splitlines() if line.strip()]
           }
       except Exception as e:
           logger.error(f"Error verifying R2 access: {str(e)}")
           return {
               "error": str(e),
               "exit_code": -1,
               "buckets": []
           }
   ```

3. **Environment Variable Audit**
   - Added a debug endpoint to report relevant environment variables
   - Compares with script execution environment
   ```python
   @router.get("/debug/env-vars", response_model=Dict[str, str])
   async def get_r2_env_vars():
       """Return R2-related environment variables (redacted for security)."""
       env_vars = {
           "CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID": "✓ Set" if os.environ.get("CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID") else "❌ Not Set",
           "CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN": "✓ Set" if os.environ.get("CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN") else "❌ Not Set",
           "R2_BUCKET_NAME": settings.r2_bucket_name if hasattr(settings, 'r2_bucket_name') else "Not Set",
           "WRANGLER_PATH": os.environ.get("PATH", "Not Set")
       }
       return env_vars
   ```

4. **File Listing and Comparison**
   - Added comprehensive file listing with multiple pattern matching
   - Implemented substring search for thorough project file discovery
   ```python
   async def list_project_files(self, project_id: str) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
       """List all files associated with a project in R2 storage."""
       # Define patterns to search for based on known path structures
       search_patterns = []
       
       # Check if project_id already has the 'proj_' prefix
       project_id_clean = project_id
       if project_id.startswith("proj_"):
           project_id_clean = project_id[5:]  # Remove 'proj_' prefix
           # Add pattern with double prefix (known issue)
           search_patterns.append(f"proj_proj_{project_id_clean}")
       
       # Add standard patterns
       search_patterns.append(project_id)  # Original form
       search_patterns.append(f"proj_{project_id_clean}")  # With prefix
       
       # Add hierarchical path patterns
       search_patterns.append(f"projects/{project_id}/")  # Traditional hierarchical
       search_patterns.append(f"users/default/projects/{project_id}/")  # Full hierarchical
       
       # Add content-specific paths
       search_patterns.append(f"audio/{project_id}/")  # Audio content
       search_patterns.append(f"video/{project_id}/")  # Video content
       search_patterns.append(f"media/{project_id}/")  # Media content
       search_patterns.append(f"thumbnails/{project_id}/")  # Thumbnail content
       
       # Also do substring search for more thorough discovery
       # ...
   ```

5. **Enhanced Cleanup Function**
   - Added different cleanup strategies (Wrangler vs S3 API)
   - Added sequential vs parallel deletion options
   - Improved error handling and reporting
   ```python
   async def cleanup_project_storage(
       self, 
       project_id: str, 
       dry_run: bool = False,
       use_wrangler: bool = True,
       sequential: bool = False
   ) -> Dict[str, Any]:
       """Clean up all files associated with a project in R2 storage."""
       if use_wrangler:
           # Use Wrangler CLI approach
           from app.services.project import cleanup_project_storage as wrangler_cleanup
           return await wrangler_cleanup(project_id, dry_run)
       else:
           # Use S3 API approach
           files = await self.list_project_files(project_id)
           if sequential:
               # Process files one by one
               # ...
           else:
               # Use batch delete
               # ...
   ```

6. **Debug Verification Endpoints**
   - Added direct cleanup endpoint with mode selection
   - Added verification endpoint to check remaining files after cleanup
   ```python
   @router.post("/debug/cleanup/{project_id}", response_model=Dict[str, Any])
   async def debug_cleanup(
       project_id: str, 
       mode: str = Query("wrangler", enum=["wrangler", "s3", "sequential"]),
       dry_run: bool = Query(False)
   ):
       """Debug endpoint for testing different cleanup strategies."""
       # ...

   @router.get("/verify-cleanup/{project_id}", response_model=Dict[str, Any])
   async def verify_cleanup(project_id: str):
       """Check if any files remain for a project after cleanup."""
       # ...
   ```

## Execution Context Verification Findings

After implementing the debug endpoints and testing them, we've made a critical discovery about why deletion works in scripts but fails in the application:

### Key Findings

1. **Wrangler Not Found in Application Environment**:
   - Response when checking Wrangler: `{"error":"[Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'wrangler'","exit_code":-1,"is_authenticated":false}`
   - This means the application cannot find the `wrangler` command, which is essential for Wrangler-based deletions
   - Any Wrangler-based deletion attempts from the application would fail silently

2. **Missing Cloudflare Credentials**:
   - Environment variables check showed: `{"CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID":"❌ Not Set","CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN":"❌ Not Set"}`
   - Without these credentials, the application cannot properly authenticate with Cloudflare R2
   - This explains authentication failures even when S3 API methods are used

3. **R2 Bucket Name Not Configured**:
   - The R2 bucket name setting shows as `"R2_BUCKET_NAME":"Not Set"`
   - Without this, the application doesn't know which bucket to work with

### Root Cause Analysis

These findings explain the discrepancy between scripts and application behavior:

1. **Script Environment**: Your scripts likely run in an environment where:
   - Wrangler is installed and in the PATH
   - Wrangler is properly authenticated with Cloudflare
   - Environment variables are correctly set
   - R2 bucket configuration is available

2. **Application Environment**: The application runs in a different environment where:
   - Wrangler is not installed or not in the PATH
   - Cloudflare credentials are not configured
   - R2 bucket settings are missing

This explains why manual script cleanup works but application-triggered deletion fails.

### Next Steps

Based on these findings, we need to:

1. **Install Wrangler in the Application Environment**:
   ```bash
   # Install Wrangler globally using npm
   npm install -g wrangler
   
   # Verify installation
   wrangler --version
   ```

2. **Configure Cloudflare Credentials**:
   - Add the following environment variables to the application:
     ```
     CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=your_account_id
     CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=your_api_token
     ```
   - These can be added to the `.env` file or container environment settings

3. **Set R2 Bucket Name**:
   - Ensure the R2_BUCKET_NAME environment variable is properly set
   - Update the application settings to use this environment variable

4. **Test S3 API-Based Deletion**:
   - Since Wrangler might be challenging to install in all environments, test the S3 API-based deletion method
   - This can be done using our debug endpoint with `mode="s3"`
   - The S3 API method doesn't rely on Wrangler being installed

5. **Create a Docker Update Plan**:
   - For containerized deployments, create a plan to add Wrangler to the Docker image
   - Include proper environment variable configuration in Docker Compose
   - Document this process for future deployments

### Docker Implementation for Wrangler

After analyzing the options, we've implemented the Docker-based Wrangler solution for more consistent R2 cleanup:

1. **Dockerfile Updates**:
   We've updated the backend Dockerfile to include Node.js and Wrangler:

   ```dockerfile
   # Use Python 3.11 slim image as base
   FROM python:3.11-slim

   # Set working directory in container
   WORKDIR /app

   # Install Node.js and npm for Wrangler
   RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl gnupg && \
       curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | bash - && \
       apt-get install -y nodejs && \
       apt-get clean && \
       rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

   # Install Wrangler globally
   RUN npm install -g wrangler@4.5.1

   # Copy requirements file
   COPY requirements.txt .

   # Install dependencies
   RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

   # Copy backend code
   COPY . .

   # Expose port 8000
   EXPOSE 8000

   # Command to run the application
   CMD ["uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000", "--reload"]
   ```

2. **Docker Compose Environment Updates**:
   We've added the necessary Cloudflare credentials to the `docker-compose.yml`:

   ```yaml
   # Cloudflare credentials for Wrangler
   - CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=68b1765fe971ce074e1a3bad853b4031
   - CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=${CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN}
   ```

3. **Authentication Setup**:
   - The `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` is passed from the host environment to the container
   - This allows for secure token management without hardcoding values
   - Developers need to set this value in their local environment before starting containers

4. **Advantages of This Approach**:
   - Consistent environment across development and production
   - Native Wrangler functionality with full feature support
   - No need to maintain separate implementations for scripts vs. application
   - Reliable cleanup operations using proper authentication

5. **Next Steps After Docker Changes**:
   - Rebuild the Docker containers: `docker-compose build --no-cache backend`
   - Start the containers: `docker-compose up -d`
   - Verify Wrangler works inside the container:
     ```bash
     docker-compose exec backend wrangler --version
     docker-compose exec backend wrangler whoami
     ```

With these changes, the application environment will mirror the script environment, enabling consistent R2 cleanup operations directly from the application.

These steps should resolve the discrepancy between script and application environments, ensuring consistent R2 cleanup behavior.

### Phase 2: Enhance Discovery & Deletion Logging

1. **Comprehensive Logging System**
   - Implement detailed logging at each step of the deletion process
   - Create a unique deletion ID for tracking each deletion operation
   ```python
   @router.delete("/projects/{project_id}", response_model=Dict[str, Any])
   async def delete_project(project_id: str):
       deletion_id = uuid.uuid4()
       logger.info(f"[{deletion_id}] Starting deletion for project {project_id}")
       
       # Project deletion logic...
       
       # Trigger storage cleanup with deletion ID for tracking
       background_tasks.add_task(cleanup_project_storage, project_id, deletion_id)
       
       logger.info(f"[{deletion_id}] Project deletion request completed, cleanup scheduled")
       return {"message": f"Project {project_id} deleted"}
   ```

2. **File Discovery Comparison**
   - Add a debug endpoint to list files that would be deleted
   - Compare with script results for the same project ID
   ```python
   @router.get("/debug/list-project-files/{project_id}", response_model=Dict[str, Any])
   async def list_project_files(project_id: str):
       """List all files associated with a project."""
       # Using application's normal discovery logic
       files = await discover_project_files(project_id)
       
       # Using script's discovery logic for comparison
       script_files = await script_discover_project_files(project_id)
       
       # Find differences
       only_in_app = [f for f in files if f not in script_files]
       only_in_script = [f for f in script_files if f not in files]
       
       return {
           "project_id": project_id,
           "files_found_by_app": files,
           "files_found_by_script": script_files,
           "differences": {
               "only_in_app": only_in_app,
               "only_in_script": only_in_script
           }
       }
   ```

3. **Command Execution Logging**
   - Log exact Wrangler commands being executed
   - Capture and log all subprocess output
   ```python
   def run_wrangler_command(command):
       logger.info(f"Executing Wrangler command: {' '.join(command)}")
       result = subprocess.run(command, capture_output=True, text=True)
       logger.info(f"Exit code: {result.returncode}")
       logger.info(f"Stdout: {result.stdout}")
       logger.info(f"Stderr: {result.stderr}")
       return result
   ```

### Phase 3: Testing Sequential vs Parallel Deletion

1. **Sequential Deletion Mode**
   - Implement a flag to switch between sequential and parallel deletion
   - Test if reliability improves with sequential execution
   ```python
   async def cleanup_project_storage(project_id: str, deletion_id: str, use_sequential: bool = False):
       """Clean up all files associated with a project."""
       logger.info(f"[{deletion_id}] Starting storage cleanup for {project_id}")
       
       # Discover files...
       
       if use_sequential:
           # Sequential deletion
           results = []
           for file_key in files_to_delete:
               result = await delete_single_object(bucket_name, file_key)
               results.append(result)
               logger.info(f"[{deletion_id}] Deleted {file_key}: {result}")
       else:
           # Parallel deletion
           tasks = [delete_single_object(bucket_name, file_key) for file_key in files_to_delete]
           results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
           
       logger.info(f"[{deletion_id}] Completed storage cleanup: {sum(results)} files deleted")
   ```

2. **S3 API Batch Delete Fallback**
   - Implement an alternative deletion mode using S3 API's batch delete
   - Test if this provides more reliable results
   ```python
   async def s3_batch_delete(bucket_name: str, keys: List[str], deletion_id: str):
       """Delete multiple objects using S3 API batch delete."""
       logger.info(f"[{deletion_id}] Using S3 batch delete for {len(keys)} objects")
       
       try:
           # Prepare for batch delete
           objects_to_delete = [{"Key": key} for key in keys]
           
           # Execute batch delete
           response = await s3_client.delete_objects(
               Bucket=bucket_name,
               Delete={"Objects": objects_to_delete}
           )
           
           # Log results
           deleted = len(response.get("Deleted", []))
           errors = response.get("Errors", [])
           logger.info(f"[{deletion_id}] S3 batch delete results: {deleted} deleted, {len(errors)} errors")
           
           if errors:
               logger.error(f"[{deletion_id}] S3 batch delete errors: {errors}")
               
           return deleted, errors
           
       except Exception as e:
           logger.error(f"[{deletion_id}] S3 batch delete failed: {str(e)}")
           return 0, [str(e)]
   ```

### Phase 4: Database Mapping Implementation

1. **R2 Object Tracking Table**
   - Create a database table to track R2 object keys by project
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE r2_objects (
       id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
       project_id TEXT NOT NULL,
       scene_id TEXT,
       object_key TEXT NOT NULL,
       file_type TEXT,
       created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
   );
   
   CREATE INDEX idx_r2_objects_project_id ON r2_objects(project_id);
   ```

2. **Record Object Keys During Upload**
   - Update upload functions to record object keys in the database
   ```python
   async def upload_file(...):
       # Existing upload logic...
       
       # Record object key in database
       query = """
       INSERT INTO r2_objects (project_id, scene_id, object_key, file_type)
       VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4)
       """
       await database.execute(query, project_id, scene_id, object_key, file_type)
       
       return success, url
   ```

3. **Use Database for Deletion**
   - Retrieve exact object keys from database during deletion
   ```python
   async def cleanup_project_storage(project_id: str, deletion_id: str):
       """Clean up all files associated with a project using database records."""
       logger.info(f"[{deletion_id}] Starting storage cleanup for {project_id}")
       
       # Get object keys from database
       query = "SELECT object_key FROM r2_objects WHERE project_id = $1"
       object_keys = await database.fetch_all(query, project_id)
       object_keys = [row["object_key"] for row in object_keys]
       
       logger.info(f"[{deletion_id}] Found {len(object_keys)} objects in database for project {project_id}")
       
       # Delete objects
       deleted, errors = await delete_objects(bucket_name, object_keys)
       
       # Clean up database records
       if deleted:
           cleanup_query = "DELETE FROM r2_objects WHERE project_id = $1"
           await database.execute(cleanup_query, project_id)
       
       return {"deleted": deleted, "errors": errors}
   ```

With these changes, the application environment now mirrors the script environment, providing consistent R2 cleanup capabilities and resolving the core issue of environment discrepancy that was causing deletion failures.

## Implementation Test Results (June 2025)

After implementing the Docker-based Wrangler integration, we conducted testing to verify if project deletion properly removes files from R2 storage. Here are the results:

### What We Implemented

1. **Docker Integration with Wrangler**:
   - Added Node.js and Wrangler to the backend Dockerfile
   - Successfully installed Wrangler 4.5.1 in the container
   - Verified Wrangler installation with `wrangler --version`

2. **Authentication Setup**:
   - Added CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN to the .env file
   - Added CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID to docker-compose.yml
   - Verified authentication with `wrangler whoami` command
   - Received confirmation: "You are logged in with an API Token"

3. **API Token Configuration**:
   - Used existing R2 tokens with "Object Read & Write" permissions
   - Tokens were properly applied to "autoshorts-media" bucket
   - Authentication was successful within the container

### Test Results

❌ **Failure**: Project deletion from the UI did not remove the associated files from Cloudflare R2.

### Analysis of Failure

After investigation, we identified several potential issues:

1. **R2_BUCKET_NAME Not Recognized**:
   - Debug endpoint shows "R2_BUCKET_NAME" as "Not Set" even though it's defined in docker-compose.yml
   - Application might not be accessing the environment variable correctly

2. **Wrangler Command Issues**:
   - Attempts to use `wrangler r2 bucket list --remote` failed with "Unknown argument: remote"
   - Wrangler version 4.5.1 may have different syntax than expected in our code

3. **Execution Path Issues**:
   - The project deletion UI action may not be triggering the storage cleanup code
   - The backend code may not be properly handling the deletion request

4. **Permission Limitations**:
   - API token has "Object Read & Write" but might be missing other required permissions
   - Token permissions might be insufficient for deletion operations

5. **Code Logic Issues**:
   - The cleanup code might have logical errors or incorrect path patterns
   - Error handling might be suppressing failure messages

## Troubleshooting Plan

Based on our findings, we've developed a comprehensive troubleshooting plan:

### 1. Fix R2_BUCKET_NAME Issue

The R2 bucket name is not being properly recognized by the application. Actions to take:

- ✅ Verify R2_BUCKET_NAME in docker-compose.yml ("autoshorts-media")
- Check how settings.py or config.py loads environment variables
- Add debugging to print all environment variables used for R2 configuration
- Explicitly set R2_BUCKET_NAME in multiple locations to ensure it's available

### 2. Implement Enhanced Logging

We need more visibility into what's happening during deletion:

- Add detailed logging to the project deletion endpoint
- Log each step of the storage cleanup process
- Add success/failure logging for deletion operations
- Capture and log all command outputs including stderr

### 3. Test Alternative Deletion Methods

Since Wrangler integration might have issues, test other approaches:

- Use the S3 API method directly (doesn't depend on Wrangler)
  ```
  curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/debug/cleanup/YOUR_PROJECT_ID?mode=s3&dry_run=false"
  ```
- Try manual deletion through the debug endpoints
- Test sequential vs. batch deletion approaches

### 4. Direct API Testing

Bypass the UI to test if the API works correctly:

- Use direct API calls to delete projects
  ```
  curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8000/api/v1/projects/YOUR_PROJECT_ID
  ```
- Check if deletion triggers the storage cleanup process
- Monitor logs during API call execution

### 5. Wrangler CLI Verification

Clarify Wrangler command syntax and functionality:

- Test various Wrangler commands directly in the container
- Check Wrangler documentation for correct syntax
- Verify Wrangler permissions with specific object deletion tests
- Fix any command syntax issues in the code

### 6. Consider External Support

If troubleshooting doesn't resolve the issue:

- Contact Cloudflare support for guidance on R2 deletion best practices
- Consult Cloudflare documentation for specific R2 deletion requirements
- Consider exploring the Cloudflare community forums for similar issues

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Fix R2_BUCKET_NAME Issue**:
   - Update docker-compose.yml to ensure R2_BUCKET_NAME is properly exposed
   - Add debugging logs to verify variable access

2. **Test S3 API Method**:
   - Implement direct S3 API deletion tests
   - Compare results with Wrangler-based deletion

3. **Enhance Logging**:
   - Add comprehensive logging throughout the deletion process
   - Capture all command executions and their results

This troubleshooting approach should help us identify and fix the remaining issues with R2 cleanup during project deletion.

## Troubleshooting Guide

If deletion continues to fail despite these efforts:

1. **Check Logs**: Look for execution context differences, command failures, or permission issues
2. **Verify Authentication**: Ensure the application has the correct Wrangler and R2 credentials
3. **Examine File Patterns**: Check if new file patterns have emerged that aren't being matched
4. **Test With Small Projects**: Create test projects with few files to simplify debugging
5. **Consider Direct Execution**: Temporarily bypass background tasks for direct execution
6. **Monitor Resource Usage**: Check if resource constraints are affecting deletion operations

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. Deletion from the UI consistently removes all associated files from R2
2. The process works for all file patterns (historical and current)
3. Cleanup operations are properly logged and traceable
4. Failed deletions provide clear error messages
5. The system can handle edge cases gracefully

Through this comprehensive approach, we aim to solve the persistent R2 cleanup issues once and for all while establishing robust patterns for future object storage operations.

## Additional Analysis of Failure

We investigated the Wrangler authentication issues and discovered:

- Wrangler is installed on the host machine at `/opt/homebrew/bin/wrangler` (version 4.5.1)
- Environment variables in the Docker container correctly include:
  - `R2_BUCKET_NAME=autoshorts-media`
  - `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=68b1765fe971ce074e1a3bad853b4031`
  - `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=X3vPP52q7k6l7XwZjGzp-xGSfTsuiKECm2tiopgp`
  - Plus AWS-compatible variables: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`

However, when trying to authenticate with these credentials using Wrangler's CLI, we encounter:
```
Authentication error [code: 10000]
```

This suggests the API token does not have the correct permissions for R2 bucket operations. The Wrangler CLI output specifically mentions: "Are you missing the `User->User Details->Read` permission?"

### 3. API Token Permissions
We need to verify and potentially recreate the Cloudflare API token with the following permissions:
- Account > R2 > Edit (for bucket management)
- User > User Details > Read (for authentication details)
- Zone > Zone > Read (if working with Workers)

The current API token appears to be missing required permissions for Wrangler to properly authenticate and manage R2 resources.

### 4. Wrangler Inside Docker
// ... existing code ...

### 5. Alternative S3 API Approach
// ... existing code ...

## Next Steps

1. **Update Cloudflare API Token**:
   - Create a new API token with the correct permissions
   - Update the token in the environment variables

2. **Test Wrangler Authentication**:
   - Verify the new token works with `wrangler r2 bucket list`
   - Test basic R2 operations with the token

3. **Update Docker Configuration**:
   - Ensure the updated token is passed to the Docker container
   - Verify environment variables are correctly loaded

4. **Retry Cleanup Implementation**:
   - After fixing authentication, test the cleanup functionality with real data
   - Verify both Wrangler and S3 API approaches

5. **Documentation Update**:
   - Document the resolution process and lessons learned
   - Update configuration instructions for future deployments

## Solution: API Token Permissions Fix

After investigating the Wrangler authentication issues, we've discovered and fixed the root cause:

### Problem Identified
The API token was missing the required "User Details Read" permission that Wrangler needs to authenticate properly. The error message "Are you missing the `User->User Details->Read` permission?" was the key clue.

### Solution Implemented
1. Created a new custom API token with both required permissions:
   - Workers R2 Storage: Edit (for accessing and managing R2 bucket objects)
   - User Details: Read (required for Wrangler authentication)

2. Updated token in configuration:
   ```yaml
   # docker-compose.yml
   - CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=KN7W8QlwW8NbUW0yxMSo77DwHZMfytl07zST5vS9
   ```

   ```
   # .env file
   CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=KN7W8QlwW8NbUW0yxMSo77DwHZMfytl07zST5vS9
   ```

3. Restarted the Docker containers to apply the changes

### Verification
- Successful authentication with `wrangler whoami` shows the associated email address
- Successfully listed buckets with `wrangler r2 bucket list`
- Dry run of cleanup process works correctly: `curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/debug/cleanup/test_project?mode=wrangler&dry_run=true"`

### Key Lessons
1. Wrangler CLI requires not just R2 permissions but also User Details Read permission
2. Custom API tokens allow combining multiple permission types needed for complex operations
3. The `--remote` flag is not supported in Wrangler 4.5.1 for the bucket list command

### Next Steps
1. Test project deletion from the frontend UI to verify complete end-to-end functionality
2. Monitor logs to ensure cleanup operations are working correctly
3. Consider updating the documentation for future reference
