# Scene Component Refactoring Plan - Final Approach

## Current Structure

The Scene component has grown to almost 2000 lines of code, making it difficult to maintain, extend, and debug. It currently handles multiple responsibilities:

- Media display and controls
- Text content display and editing
- Voice generation and audio controls
- Scene card layout and management

## Challenges from Previous Refactoring Attempts

Our previous refactoring attempt (documented in Scene-Component-Refactoring-Part-Two.md) reached approximately 97% completion but ultimately failed during final integration. Key challenges we encountered:

1. **Tightly Coupled Functionality**: The components are deeply interconnected on the same scene card:
   - Media playback state affects audio controls
   - Text editing requires coordination with voice generation
   - Voice generation depends on current text content
   - Scene card layout affects all other components

2. **Shared State Management Issues**: 
   - Duplicate state variables created across components
   - State synchronization problems between components
   - Event handlers with mismatched dependencies
   - Timing issues between component initialization

3. **Integration Failures**:
   - Voice settings became disconnected from audio generation
   - Audio controls lost synchronization with audio state
   - Media player functionality was disrupted when separated from core state
   - Multiple audio elements causing conflicts

4. **Boundary Problems**:
   - The original separation points didn't respect natural coupling in the codebase
   - Tightly coupled features (like audio generation and audio controls) were placed in different files
   - CSS and styling became fragmented and lost consistency

These challenges highlight why a more carefully planned approach is necessary for the current refactoring effort.

## Four-Component Approach

We will refactor the Scene component into four distinct functional components, acknowledging their interconnected nature:
 
### 1. SceneCard
- **Purpose**: Container component that manages overall layout and core functionality
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Scene identification (number indicator in top left)
  - Info button revealing Reddit URL
  - Delete/trash bin functionality
  - Drag handle for reordering
  - Animation and transition effects
  - Container for other components

### 2. VideoPlayer
- **Purpose**: Handle all media display and controls
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Video/image display and controls
  - Media sizing and aspect ratio handling
  - Gallery navigation for multiple media
  - Compact/expanded view modes
  - Media trimming controls
  - Fullscreen functionality

### 3. TextEditor
- **Purpose**: Handle text content display and editing
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Text content display and editing
  - Word counting
  - Text expansion/collapse controls
  - Edit mode toggle
  - Save/cancel controls for text edits
  - (Future) Integration point for AI text rewriting

### 4. VoiceOverControls
- **Purpose**: Manage ElevenLabs voice generation and audio playback
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Voice selection dropdown
  - Generate voiceover button
  - Audio player controls
  - Voice settings panel
  - Progress indicators
  - Playback speed controls

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Start with the VideoPlayer Component**
   - Most self-contained with clearer boundaries
   - Likely to grow with new features
   - Easier to isolate for testing

2. **Use Feature Flags**
   - Allow switching between old and new implementations
   - Enable side-by-side testing
   - Example:
     ```tsx
     const useNewVideoPlayer = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_NEW_VIDEO_PLAYER || false;
     
     {useNewVideoPlayer ? (
       <VideoPlayer {...videoPlayerProps} />
     ) : (
       /* Original video player JSX */
     )}
     ```

3. **Create a Shared Context for State**
   - Manage shared state between components
   - Avoid excessive prop drilling
   - Example:
     ```tsx
     const SceneContext = createContext<SceneContextType | undefined>(undefined);
     
     function SceneProvider({ children, initialState }) {
       // State management logic here
       return (
         <SceneContext.Provider value={contextValue}>
           {children}
         </SceneContext.Provider>
       );
     }
     ```

4. **Extract Components One at a Time**
   - Complete and test each component before moving to the next
   - Order: VideoPlayer → TextEditor → VoiceOverControls → SceneCard

## Testing Approach

1. **Shadow Implementation**
   - Build new components alongside the original
   - Toggle between implementations for testing
   - Compare behavior between old and new versions

2. **Incremental Testing**
   - Test each component individually as it's developed
   - Verify key functionality before moving to the next component
   - Use URL parameters to enable/disable new components during testing

3. **Visual and Functional Validation**
   - Compare visual rendering between implementations
   - Test each feature with real user scenarios
   - Validate state consistency between components

## Component Interconnections and Data Flow

Understanding how these components interconnect is crucial, as their tight coupling is what made previous refactoring attempts challenging. All components exist on the same scene card and share state and functionality:

```
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                        SCENE CARD                             │
│                                                               │
│  ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐   │

│  └─────────────────────────┬──────────────────────────────┘   │
│                            │                                   │
│                            ▼                                   │
│  ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐   │
│  │                     TEXT EDITOR                        │   │
│  └─────────────────────────┬──────────────────────────────┘   │
│                            │                                   │
│                            ▼                                   │
│  ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐   │
│  │                  VOICE OVER CONTROLS                   │   │
│  └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘   │
│                                                               │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Key Data Dependencies

1. **VideoPlayer ↔ TextEditor**
   - Media duration affects text-to-audio timing
   - Media trim points need to align with text content

2. **TextEditor ↔ VoiceOverControls**
   - Text content is used for voice generation
   - Word count affects audio duration estimation
   - Text edits may require regenerating audio

3. **VoiceOverControls ↔ VideoPlayer**
   - Audio playback syncs with video playback
   - Play/pause state is shared between them
   - Audio duration may influence media trim points

4. **SceneCard ↔ All Components**
   - Manages lifecycle of all components
   - Handles animation states affecting rendering
   - Controls expansion/collapse affecting all layouts

### State Management Strategy

To handle these interconnections effectively, we'll use a combination of:

1. **Shared Context**
   - Core state accessible to all components
   - Centralized update logic
   - Consistent state synchronization

2. **Event-Based Communication**
   - Components emit events for significant changes
   - Other components react to these events
   - Reduces direct dependencies

3. **Clear Interface Boundaries**
   - Well-defined props for each component
   - Explicit callback patterns
   - Documentation of expected behavior

This understanding of data flow and dependencies will help us avoid the pitfalls of the previous refactoring attempt.

## Current Implementation Status

- ✅ Created `SceneVideoPlayerWrapper.tsx` component as initial scaffold
- ✅ Added component to scene index exports
- ✅ Updated initial implementation with proper props
- ✅ Imported into SceneComponent.tsx
- ✅ Added conditional rendering with feature flag
- ✅ Updated tests to ensure compatibility
- ✅ Completed implementation with all necessary functions and state
- ✅ Enabled feature flag in .env.local
- ✅ All tests passing successfully with the new implementation
- ✅ Code fully committed to the repository

## VideoPlayer Extraction Implementation

The extraction of the video player functionality from the SceneComponent has now been completed and deployed to production. The implementation follows these key approaches:

1. **Bridge Pattern**: The `SceneVideoPlayerWrapper` acts as a bridge between the `SceneComponent` and existing media components like `SceneMediaPlayer` and `ScenePreviewPlayer`.

2. **State Isolation**: Video-related state and handlers have been moved to the wrapper component, including:
   - View mode toggling (compact/expanded)
   - Media URL transformation and handling
   - Trim control functionality

3. **Feature Flag**: Implementation uses the `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_NEW_VIDEO_PLAYER` environment variable to toggle between old and new implementations, with a fallback mechanism.

4. **Test Compatibility**: Special handling was added to ensure tests continue to work with the original implementation when needed.

### Key Files

1. **SceneVideoPlayerWrapper.tsx**: The new component that encapsulates video player functionality
2. **SceneComponent.tsx**: Updated to use the wrapper component when the feature flag is enabled
3. **.env.local**: Updated to enable the feature flag after successful testing

### Implementation Details

The wrapper component handles:
- Media URL construction and transformation
- View mode toggling (compact/expanded)
- Error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Proper prop passing to child components

The component is designed to be a drop-in replacement for the video rendering portion of SceneComponent, making the transition seamless for users.

### Testing Results

All 10 Playwright tests pass successfully with the new implementation. The feature flag is now enabled in the production environment and the SceneVideoPlayerWrapper component is being used for all video rendering in the application.

## Next Steps

With the video player functionality successfully extracted, the next components to refactor are:

1. **Text Editor**: Extract text editing and display functionality
2. **Audio Player**: Extract audio playback functionality
3. **Scene Controls**: Extract action buttons and control functionality

Each extraction will follow the same pattern with feature flags for safe rollout.
