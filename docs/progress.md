## Future Considerations

These are alternative implementation ideas that could be explored in the future:

### BBC VideoContext for Video Editing

**Overview**: Instead of a fully custom video editing implementation, investigate using BBC's VideoContext library (open-source) for timeline-based editing and real-time preview capabilities.

**Potential Benefits**:
- Professional-grade compositing with WebGL acceleration
- Reduced development time compared to custom solution
- Real-time preview of effects and transitions
- Open-source with no licensing costs

**Key Requirements for Implementation**:
- React wrapper components for VideoContext
- Custom timeline UI that maps to VideoContext nodes
- Backend integration to convert timeline data to FFmpeg commands
- Text overlay system using Canvas
