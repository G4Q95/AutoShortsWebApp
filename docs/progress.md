### In Progress

*   **Define Video Editor Architecture:** Finalizing the decision to use `video-context` for UI/Preview and a separate rendering engine (like server-side FFmpeg) for export, driven by a JSON EDL.

### Next Steps (Immediate Focus)

1.  **Persistent Video Trimming:**
    *   Save `startTime` and `endTime` from VideoContext trim controls to MongoDB for each scene.
    *   Load these values when the editor initializes to restore trim state.
2.  **Basic Sequential Playback Preview:**
    *   Implement a "Play All" feature using VideoContext to play scenes sequentially based on their saved trim times.
    *   Focus on basic back-to-back playback, not perfect transitions yet.
3.  **Original Video Audio Integration:**
    *   Ensure VideoContext loads and plays audio from source videos during preview.
    *   (Optional) Add a volume control for original video audio per scene and save the setting.

### Future Considerations (Post-Immediate Focus)

*   **Robust Export Pipeline:**
    *   Develop backend functionality (FastAPI + FFmpeg) to render videos based on the saved JSON EDL (trim times, scene order, audio settings).
    *   Implement frontend logic to trigger export and handle download.
*   **Advanced Audio Mixing:**
    *   Implement controls for balancing original audio and voiceover levels.
    *   Ensure FFmpeg correctly mixes audio tracks during export.
*   **Transitions & Effects:**
    *   Decide on mechanism (VideoContext shaders for preview, FFmpeg filters for export, or dedicated library).
    *   Implement basic transitions (e.g., cross-fade) in the export process first.
*   **Cloudflare R2 Organization:**
    *   Define and implement a structured folder system within R2 buckets for projects, scenes, media, and audio files.
    *   Update backend upload/fetch logic accordingly.
*   **Timeline UI Enhancements:**
    *   Implement drag-and-drop reordering for scenes directly on the `VideoContextTimeline`.
    *   Add more visual cues for trims, audio waveforms, etc.

## Implementation Status (%)

*   **Core Project Setup:** 100%
*   **Content Extraction:** 95% (Reddit handling improved, ongoing robustness checks)
*   **Project Management:** 95% (Core CRUD, needs R2 cleanup refinements)
*   **Scene Management:** 90% (Media display, aspect ratios handled, needs persistent editing)
*   **Audio Generation (ElevenLabs):** 90% (Generation, controls, context management done, needs final mix/export)
*   **Video Editing Core (VideoContext):** 40% (Player/Trim UI exists, needs persistence, sequencing, audio integration)
*   **Video Export:** 0%
*   **Testing (E2E):** 90% (Good coverage, needs tests for new editing features)
*   **API Development:** 85% (Core endpoints exist, needs export endpoint, R2 structure integration)
*   **Documentation:** 80% (Good coverage, needs updates for export pipeline and R2 structure)
*   **Docker Environment:** 95% (All services running, stable)

## Key Architectural Decisions

*   **Frontend:** Next.js (React), Tailwind CSS, TypeScript
*   **Backend:** FastAPI (Python), Async
*   **Database:** MongoDB Atlas
*   **File Storage:** Cloudflare R2
*   **Video Preview/Trim UI:** `video-context` library
*   **Video Export Rendering:** Server-side FFmpeg (via FastAPI backend) driven by JSON EDL
*   **State Management:** React Context API (ProjectContext, AudioContext, VoiceContext, VideoContextProvider)
*   **Deployment:** Vercel (Frontend), Google Cloud Run (Backend)
*   **Testing:** Playwright (E2E), Pytest (Backend Units)

## Checkpoint: "video-strategy-pivot"

This checkpoint marks a strategic pivot in our video editing implementation approach. After evaluating our custom timeline scrubber implementation and encountering persistent issues with scrubber positioning and drift, we've decided to adopt BBC's VideoContext library for a more robust, professional-grade video editing experience.

### What's Changing:

1. **Video Integration Strategy (100% Revised)**:
   - ✅ Documented persistent issues with custom timeline scrubber implementation
   - ✅ Evaluated multiple approaches to resolve scrubber drift problems
   - ✅ Researched established video editing libraries for better reliability
   - ✅ Selected BBC's VideoContext as the optimal solution for our needs
   - ✅ Created comprehensive integration plan in Video-Integration-Part2.md
   - ✅ Outlined migration strategy from current implementation

2. **Implementation Timeline**:
   - Phase 1: VideoContext Integration (1-2 weeks)
   - Phase 2: Feature Integration (2-3 weeks)
   - Phase 3: Advanced Features (2-3 weeks)

3. **Technical Architecture**:
   - New component structure in dedicated video-editor directory
   - Clear separation from existing implementation during transition
   - Adapter module to connect project data to VideoContext
   - EDL generation for backend FFmpeg processing

### Why This Change:

1. **Technical Reliability**: The custom scrubber implementation exhibited persistent positioning drift issues that proved difficult to resolve.
2. **Development Efficiency**: Using an established library will significantly reduce development time.
3. **Professional Features**: VideoContext provides professional-grade capabilities that would be challenging to build from scratch.
4. **Maintainability**: Reduces the amount of custom code that needs ongoing maintenance. 

## In Progress

### Frontend - Video Player Interaction Test
- **Status:** Blocked (90% Investigation Complete)
- **Issue:** Playwright tests fail to interact (hover/click) with the scene preview element (`[data-testid="scene-media"]`) when the media type is video, even when using `force: true`.
- **Root Cause Analysis:** Console logs (both manual and from Playwright traces) show the `VideoContextScenePreviewPlayer` component undergoes constant, rapid re-rendering and state recalculations (aspect ratio, position, styling) when handling video. This component instability prevents Playwright from reliably performing actionability checks (visibility, stability) at the moment of interaction, causing timeouts.
- **Evidence:**
    - Manual hovering/playing video triggers flood of console logs from `VideoContextScenePreviewPlayer.tsx`.
    - Photo-based tests do *not* show the same level of console log activity and pass interaction checks.
    - Playwright Trace Viewer shows the target element failing actionability checks (appearing black or timing out during checks) despite the thumbnail being visible in the timeline view.
- **Conclusion:** The problem lies within the frontend `VideoContextScenePreviewPlayer.tsx` component's handling of video, causing rendering instability that breaks Playwright interactions.
- **Next Step:** Debug and refactor `VideoContextScenePreviewPlayer.tsx` (and potentially the related `VideoContext`) to stabilize video rendering and state management.

### Backend - Cloudflare R2 Integration
- **Status:** Needs Verification (70%)
- **Issue:** Ensure reliable connectivity and file operations (upload, retrieve, delete) with Cloudflare R2 storage across different environments (local Docker, deployment).
- **Tasks:**
  - Verify CORS configuration for direct browser access (needed for audio playback).
  - Implement robust error handling for R2 operations.
  - Add integration tests for R2 functionality.

## Next Steps

1.  **Refactor `VideoContextScenePreviewPlayer.tsx`:** Address the identified instability and frequent re-rendering issues when handling video media.
2.  **Refactor `VideoContext`:** Break down the large context/script into smaller, more manageable pieces, informed by the `ScenePreviewPlayer` investigation.
3.  **Fix R2 CORS:** Configure the R2 bucket to allow origins (localhost, production URL) for audio playback.
4.  **Re-enable/Fix Video Interaction Test:** Once the component is stable, re-attempt the Playwright test (`video-player.spec.ts`) to verify play/pause interactions.
5.  **Expand Test Coverage:** Add tests for trimming, volume control, etc.

## Blockers
- Frontend component instability prevents progress on video interaction tests.

## June 2024 Updates

### R2 Storage Improvements

- **Wrangler-Based R2 Integration (June 13, 2024)**: Implemented a new approach for Cloudflare R2 storage management using Wrangler, Cloudflare's official CLI tool. This implementation includes:
  - A Python wrapper around the Wrangler CLI (`WranglerR2Client` class)
  - Enhanced project file cleanup functionality
  - Helper scripts for Wrangler setup and R2 management
  - Improved logging and error handling
  - See `docs/Cloudflare-R2-Reconfig-Round-Two.md` for details

# Development Progress Tracker

**Current Date:** 2025-04-03

**Overall Progress:** 66% (Estimate)

**Development Environment:** Docker (Compose) - All services running.

**Recent Accomplishments:**
- Successfully connected backend to MongoDB Atlas (real database).
- Fixed database connection logic in `database.py`.
- Corrected test cleanup logic in `debug.py` to handle real MongoDB cursors.
- Fixed backend 500 errors during media storage (`TypeError` on `upload_file` arguments, `AttributeError` on tuple return handling) in `media_service.py`.
- Added detailed timing logs to `media_service.py` for media download/upload steps.
- Confirmed backend fixes with serial Playwright tests (`NEXT_PUBLIC_MOCK_AUDIO=false`).
- Investigated `Scene deletion` test flakiness related to media loading timeout.
- Added and subsequently removed debug logging in `media-utils.ts` and `SceneMediaPlayer.tsx` to trace media URL propagation.
- Increased Playwright timeout for media element check in `Scene deletion` test from 15s to 30s, stabilizing the `Scene deletion` test.
- Fixed critical video playback issues in `VideoContextScenePreviewPlayer`.
- Resolved complex scene rendering issues after URL addition (identified and removed duplicate API calls in `ProjectProvider`, fixed state update timing in `ProjectReducer`).
- Resolved Git detached HEAD state after commit `3a8563f` and successfully merged changes onto `r2-refactoring` branch.

**Current Implementation Tasks:**

### In Progress (As of 2025-04-03)
- **Investigating Intermittent Frontend Errors (30%):**
  - `TypeError: Failed to fetch` / `service_unavailable` errors still appear intermittently in serial tests, primarily during cleanup phases. Root cause unclear.
- **Addressing Playwright Test Console Errors (15%):**
  - React `Warning: Received NaN for the '%s' attribute...` in video player controls.
  - `@hello-pangea/dnd` `Invariant failed: Draggable[id: ...]: Unable to find drag handle` error still appears during scene deletion test teardown, but does not cause test failure.
- **Refactor Media Handling & R2 Integration:** Complete the refactoring of media downloading, storage (R2), and preview logic across frontend and backend. (Est. 85% complete)
  - Frontend context and download manager improvements.
  - Backend R2 upload endpoints.
  - Ensuring smooth preview playback with R2 URLs.

### Next Steps / Backlog
- Stabilize Playwright E2E tests (address remaining console errors and potential flakiness).
- Investigate the intermittent frontend fetch/service_unavailable errors further if they persist or block development.
- Implement robust thumbnail generation for various media types.
- Refine UI/UX based on testing feedback (e.g., loading states, error display).
- Implement full gallery support (currently only processes first image).
- Complete direct file upload functionality (`/api/v1/media/upload`).
- Enhance error handling consistency across frontend/backend.
- Add integration tests for backend services.
- Configure production deployment pipeline (Google Cloud Run / Vercel).

## Completed Tasks
- Setup base project structure (Next.js Frontend, FastAPI Backend).
- Dockerized development environment.
- Implemented core project/scene state management (frontend).
- Implemented basic UI layout (header, sidebar, main content).
- Integrated Cloudflare R2 storage via backend service (`storage.py`).
- Implemented content extraction service (`content_retrieval.py`).
- Implemented media download and storage service (`media_service.py`).
- Implemented API endpoints for content extraction and media storage.
- Integrated basic Monaco editor for scene text editing.
- Setup Playwright for E2E testing.
- Implemented basic project creation and scene addition tests.
- Integrated MongoDB Atlas connection.
- Fixed database connection logic (`database.py`).
- Corrected test data cleanup (`debug.py`) for real MongoDB.
- Fixed backend 500 error (`TypeError: R2Storage.upload_file() got an unexpected keyword argument 'filename'`) in `media_service.py`.
- Fixed backend 500 error (`AttributeError: 'tuple' object has no attribute 'get'`) in `media_service.py` by correctly handling `upload_file` return value.
- Added detailed timing logs to `media_service.py`.
- Stabilized `Scene deletion` Playwright test by increasing media check timeout.
- Fixed video playback in `VideoContextScenePreviewPlayer`.
- Debugged and fixed scene rendering after URL addition (duplicate API calls, state management).
- Corrected Git state (detached HEAD) and merged changes to `r2-refactoring`.
- **Test Framework Refactoring (Phase 2 Complete):** Migrated all tests to domain-specific files, implemented helpers, added data-testid attributes, resolved all failures, removed `core-functionality.spec.ts`. (April 5, 2025)
- **GitHub MCP Troubleshooting:** Diagnosed connection stability issues with Smithery GitHub MCP, likely due to server-side problems. (April 3, 2025)
- **Microsoft Playwright MCP Setup:** Successfully configured and tested the official `@playwright/mcp` server for interactive browser control during development. (April 3, 2025)

## Blocker Issues
- None currently blocking core development, but intermittent frontend errors need monitoring.

## Key Decisions Made / Debugging Insights
- Increased default API client timeout from 10s to 60s (temporary for diagnosis, confirmed necessity for R2 uploads). Will monitor if this can be reduced later.
- Using simplified, flat R2 storage paths based on project/scene IDs.
- Added detailed timing logs to diagnose media storage performance.
- Increased media loading check timeout in `Scene deletion` test to 30s to improve stability.
- Scene rendering debug highlighted the fragility of state updates across `Provider` -> `Reducer` -> `Component`. Duplicate API calls (`storeSceneMedia` in `addScene`) were found to be a major cause of timing issues and incorrect loading states. Simplified `SceneComponent` rendering logic to rely more directly on `media.url` presence.

    *   **Achieved Stable State:** Identified commit `d782e56` ("All Working!") as stable base where all E2E tests pass.
    *   **R2 Purge Confirmed:** Successfully ran the `r2_purger.py` script to empty the bucket.
    *   **(Reverted) Debug Test Cleanup Attempts:** Reverted recent attempts to implement automated test cleanup in Playwright due to unexpected test failures.
*   **March 30:**
    *   **Achieved Stable State:** Identified commit `d782e56` ("All Working!") as stable base where all E2E tests pass.
*   **June 2024:**
    *   **Fixed Cloudflare R2 Authentication Issues:** Diagnosed and resolved 401 Unauthorized errors when accessing the R2 bucket
    *   **Updated R2 credentials in both root and backend .env files with valid API token**
    *   **Verified successful uploads and storage operations through backend logs**
    *   **Ensured proper initialization of the R2 client in the application**
    *   **Rebuilt Docker containers to properly apply updated environment variables**
    *   **Created standalone `r2_purger.py` script for bulk cleaning of R2 bucket**

    *   **Fixed R2 File Deletion (Bug):** Identified and fixed incorrect `async`/`await` usage with synchronous boto3 S3 client.
    *   **Corrected return type handling in debug endpoints (`test_delete_sync`, `test_upload`).**
    *   **Fixed `list_project_files` to use correct loop for paginator.**
    *   **Updated `verify_cleanup` endpoint for better accuracy.**
    *   **Corrected `settings.r2_bucket_name` typo to `settings.R2_BUCKET_NAME` in the pattern-based deletion fallback within `project.py`'s `cleanup_project_storage` function.**
    *   **Current Strategy:** Backend uses S3 API directly. Primary: Database tracked files. Fallback: Pattern matching. Worker/Wrangler are not the active methods.**

## In Progress / Next Steps

1.  **Video Voice Generation:**
    *   **Status:** Active.
    *   **Goal:** Integrate ElevenLabs API for voice generation based on scene text. Add UI elements for voice selection and preview.
2.  **Video Preview & Customization:**
    *   **Status:** Next Up.
    *   **Goal:** Implement the `/projects/{id}/preview` route. Allow users to customize scene timings, potentially visuals, and preview the final video sequence.
3.  **(Future) Re-evaluate Test Cleanup Strategy:**
    *   **Status:** On Hold.
    *   **Goal:** Develop a reliable and non-interfering method to clean up test-generated projects and R2 files after Playwright runs. Current method: Manual execution of `r2_purger.py`.
4.  **(Future) R2 Refactoring:**
    *   **Status:** On Hold. (See `docs/R2-Refactoring-Plan.md`)
    *   **Goal:** Simplify and clean up R2 interaction code, remove unused config/code.
5.  **Fix Flaky Tests (Backend Connection):** Investigate and resolve the intermittent `service_unavailable` errors occurring during Playwright tests, preventing the frontend from reliably communicating with the backend. (0%)
