## Future Considerations

These are alternative implementation ideas that could be explored in the future:

### BBC VideoContext for Video Editor

**Overview**: Instead of a fully custom video editing implementation, investigate using BBC's VideoContext library (open-source) for timeline-based editing and real-time preview capabilities.

**Potential Benefits**:
- Professional-grade compositing with WebGL acceleration
- Reduced development time compared to custom solution
- Real-time preview of effects and transitions
- Open-source with no licensing costs

**Key Requirements for Implementation**:
- React wrapper components for VideoContext
- Custom timeline UI that maps to VideoContext nodes
- Backend integration to convert timeline data to FFmpeg commands
- Text overlay system using Canvas

**Research Links**:
- [BBC VideoContext GitHub](https://github.com/bbc/VideoContext)
- [API Documentation](https://github.com/bbc/VideoContext/blob/master/docs/API.md)

### Scene Export for External Editors

**Overview**: Provide functionality to export individual scenes with paired voiceover audio for use in professional video editing software like CapCut, DaVinci Resolve, or Adobe Premiere.

**Potential Benefits**:
- Reduced development complexity (no need for full editing UI)
- Flexibility for power users who prefer dedicated editing tools
- Faster path to high-quality video production
- Complementary to built-in video generation

**Key Requirements for Implementation**:
- Export format options (individual clips, pre-rendered scenes)
- Project file exports for specific editors (XML, EDL formats)
- Proper audio-visual synchronization in exports
- Batch export capabilities with progress tracking

**Possible Export Formats**:
- Individual scene video clips with embedded audio
- XML project files for DaVinci Resolve/Final Cut
- EDL (Edit Decision List) for broader compatibility
- Scene metadata in JSON format
