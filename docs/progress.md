## Checkpoint: "video-strategy-pivot"

This checkpoint marks a strategic pivot in our video editing implementation approach. After evaluating our custom timeline scrubber implementation and encountering persistent issues with scrubber positioning and drift, we've decided to adopt BBC's VideoContext library for a more robust, professional-grade video editing experience.

### What's Changing:

1. **Video Integration Strategy (100% Revised)**:
   - ✅ Documented persistent issues with custom timeline scrubber implementation
   - ✅ Evaluated multiple approaches to resolve scrubber drift problems
   - ✅ Researched established video editing libraries for better reliability
   - ✅ Selected BBC's VideoContext as the optimal solution for our needs
   - ✅ Created comprehensive integration plan in Video-Integration-Part2.md
   - ✅ Outlined migration strategy from current implementation

2. **Implementation Timeline**:
   - Phase 1: VideoContext Integration (1-2 weeks)
   - Phase 2: Feature Integration (2-3 weeks)
   - Phase 3: Advanced Features (2-3 weeks)

3. **Technical Architecture**:
   - New component structure in dedicated video-editor directory
   - Clear separation from existing implementation during transition
   - Adapter module to connect project data to VideoContext
   - EDL generation for backend FFmpeg processing

### Why This Change:

1. **Technical Reliability**: The custom scrubber implementation exhibited persistent positioning drift issues that proved difficult to resolve.
2. **Development Efficiency**: Using an established library will significantly reduce development time.
3. **Professional Features**: VideoContext provides professional-grade capabilities that would be challenging to build from scratch.
4. **Maintainability**: Reduces the amount of custom code that needs ongoing maintenance.
