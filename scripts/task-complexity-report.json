      "taskTitle": "Implement Audio Extraction with ffmpeg",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of audio extraction with ffmpeg into subtasks, including ffmpeg integration, background processing setup, R2 storage upload implementation, and error handling.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves subprocess management, ffmpeg parameter configuration, file handling, R2 storage integration, and asynchronous processing with both FastAPI and Celery. The multiple technical components and integration points increase complexity."

      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Update Database Models for Audio URLs",
      "complexityScore": 3,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the database model update task into subtasks covering schema changes, migration script creation, and validation of data integrity for existing records.",
      "reasoning": "This is a relatively straightforward database schema update with two new fields. The complexity is low, though it requires understanding the existing MongoDB schema and potentially creating migration scripts."

      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Refactor API Endpoints to Use audio_service.py",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the API endpoint refactoring task into subtasks covering voice generation endpoint updates, video processing endpoint modifications, response format standardization, and testing of the new flow.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires modifying multiple existing endpoints and changing the data flow. It has dependencies on multiple other tasks and involves understanding both the current implementation and the new audio service architecture."

      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Create Web Audio API React Hooks",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Web Audio API React hooks development into subtasks for each hook (useWebAudioLoader, useAudioPlaybackSync, useAudioTrackManager), plus integration testing and documentation.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves creating complex React hooks that interact with the Web Audio API, which has a steep learning curve. Managing audio buffers, synchronization with video, and track management adds significant complexity. The hooks need to work together seamlessly."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Audio Track Toggle and Volume Control",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the audio track toggle and volume control implementation into subtasks covering UI component creation, integration with Web Audio API hooks, and user experience testing.",
      "reasoning": "This task is moderately complex as it involves creating UI components and connecting them to the Web Audio API hooks. The actual implementation is straightforward once the hooks are in place, though proper UX considerations add some complexity."

      "taskTitle": "Develop Waveform Visualization Component",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the waveform visualization component development into subtasks covering audio data extraction, canvas rendering optimization, styling for different track types, integration with timeline, and performance testing.",
      "reasoning": "Creating a performant waveform visualization is complex, involving canvas manipulation, audio data processing, and potentially performance optimizations. The component needs to handle multiple tracks and different view modes, adding to the complexity."

    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Expandable Timeline",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the expandable timeline implementation into subtasks covering component state management, animation of expansion/collapse, integration with existing timeline, and waveform visualization integration.",
      "reasoning": "This component requires careful state management and animation, plus integration with both the existing timeline and the new waveform visualization. The interaction between these components adds complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Add Draggable Voiceover Track",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the draggable voiceover track implementation into subtasks covering drag-and-drop functionality, offset calculation and storage, visual feedback during dragging, and integration with audio playback.",
      "reasoning": "Implementing drag-and-drop functionality with proper time offset calculation is complex. The component needs to update the audio playback in real-time and provide visual feedback, requiring careful coordination between UI and audio systems."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 10,
      "taskTitle": "Integrate and Test Complete Audio System",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the audio system integration task into subtasks covering backend-frontend connection, comprehensive testing scenarios, performance optimization, bug fixing, and documentation.",
      "reasoning": "This integration task has dependencies on all previous audio-related tasks and requires ensuring that all components work together seamlessly. Testing the complete workflow and addressing any integration issues adds significant complexity."

      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the yt-dlp media download service implementation into subtasks covering library integration, source-specific handlers, progress reporting, caching mechanism, and error handling strategies.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves integrating a complex external library (yt-dlp) and handling multiple media sources with different requirements. The asynchronous nature, progress reporting, caching, and comprehensive error handling add significant complexity."
