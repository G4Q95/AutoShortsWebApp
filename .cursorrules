# Auto Shorts Web App - Cursor Rules

You are an expert in Next.js with React along with Tailwind CSS, FastAPI (Python), MongoDB Atlas, Cloudflare R2, Google Cloud Run and Vercel. With a deep understanding of best practices and performance optimization techniques in these technologies.

## Coding Pattern Preferences

- Always prefer simple solutions
- Avoid duplication of code whenever possible, which means checking for other areas of the codebase that might already have similar code and functionality
- Write code that takes into account the different environments: dev, test, and prod
- You are careful to only make changes that are requested or you are confident are well understood and related to the change being requested
- When fixing an issue or bug, do not introduce a new pattern or technology without first exhausting all options for the existing implementation. And if you finally do this, make sure to remove the old implementation afterwards so we don't have duplicate logic.
- Keep the codebase very clean and organized
- Avoid writing scripts in files if possible, especially if the script is likely only to be run once
- Mocking data is only needed for tests, never mock data for dev or prod
- Never add stubbing or fake data patterns to code that affects the dev or prod environments
- Never overwrite .env file without first asking and confirming

## Coding Workflow Preferences

- Focus on the areas of code relevant to the task
- Do not touch code that is unrelated to the task
- Write thorough tests for all major functionality
- Avoid making major changes to the patterns and architecture of how a feature works, after it has shown to work well, unless explicitly instructed
- Always think about what other methods and areas of code might be affected by code changes
- Run tests after making significant changes to ensure they still pass with the new implementation
- If tests fail after changes, address test failures before continuing with new features
- When changing UI components or selectors, check that existing E2E tests still work with the new structure

## Browser MCP Tool Usage Guidelines

When working with the browser frontend:
1. **Proactive Log Checking**: Check console logs, errors, and network activity at these key moments:
   - At the beginning of each chat session
   - After any code changes
   - Before and after testing frontend functionality
   - When debugging issues
   - Every few minutes during active development

2. **Network Monitoring**:
   - Check network requests when working with API endpoints
   - Examine request/response payloads for debugging
   - Monitor for 4xx/5xx errors in network calls

3. **Console Error Priority**:
   - Treat console errors as high-priority issues
   - Address JS errors before proceeding with new features
   - Check warning messages that may indicate potential issues

4. **Screenshot Strategy**:
   - Take screenshots to verify UI changes
   - Capture the UI state before and after interactions
   - Use screenshots to document the current state for reference

5. **Element Examination**:
   - Check rendered components when implementing or debugging UI
   - Verify CSS classes are applied correctly
   - Examine DOM structure when working with dynamic content

6. **Server Status Management**:
   - If Browser Tools server is not running, automatically attempt to restart it using `npx browser-tools-server`
   - If frontend server is not responding, try restarting it with `cd /web/frontend && npm run dev`
   - If backend server is not responding, try restarting it with `cd /web/backend && python -m app.main`
   - If port issues occur, suggest closing ports and retrying (e.g., `lsof -i :PORT` to check, then `kill -9 PID` to close)
   - Report server status issues if they persist after restart attempts

## GitHub MCP Tool Usage Guidelines

When working with GitHub:
1. **Repository Interaction**:
   - Use `mcp__get_file_contents` to examine external repositories for reference code
   - Use `mcp__push_files` for batch commits that belong together
   - Use `mcp__search_code` to find relevant code examples in GitHub

2. **Issue Management**:
   - Check existing issues before creating new ones
   - Reference related issues in commit messages
   - Update issue status when implementing fixes

3. **Pull Request Workflow**:
   - Create feature branches for each major task
   - Include comprehensive descriptions in PRs
   - Link PRs to relevant issues

4. **Best Practices**:
   - Always check for file existence before attempting to update
   - Use meaningful commit messages following the convention
   - Batch related changes into single commits

## Git Commit Conventions

Use the following prefixes for commit messages followed by a colon and a space:
- "fix:" for bug fixes
- "feat:" for new features
- "perf:" for performance improvements
- "docs:" for documentation changes
- "style:" for formatting changes
- "refactor:" for code refactoring
- "test:" for adding missing tests
- "chore:" for chore tasks

When determining the commit message prefix, pick the most relevant prefix from the list above.
Use lower case for commit messages.
The commit message should also include a list of the changes made in the commit after the summary line if the changes are not self explanatory.

## Documentation Update Guidelines

When making changes to the codebase, documentation must be updated to maintain accuracy. Follow these guidelines:

1. **progress.md** - Update with every significant change
   - Update after each completed feature or bug fix
   - Modify at the end of each productive chat session with Claude
   - Move completed items from "In Progress" to "Completed Tasks"
   - Add new items to "Next Steps" when they become relevant
   - Update implementation status percentages to reflect actual progress

2. **PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.md** - Update when implementation plans change
   - Update the "Current Implementation Tasks" section when tasks are completed
   - Add new implementation tasks when the roadmap changes
   - Keep technical implementation details accurate and current

3. **README.md** - Update when user-facing information changes
   - Update the "Current Development Status" when major milestones are reached
   - Revise setup instructions when dependencies or processes change
   - Modify the feature list when new features are implemented

4. **PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md** - Update for significant architectural changes
   - Update only when business model, architecture, or core concepts change
   - Remove the "Project Status Update" section (use progress.md instead)
   - Keep technical decisions and rationale sections current

When updating documentation:
- Always explain the changes in your message to the user
- Include which files were updated and why
- Highlight any significant changes to project status or architecture

## End of Chat Commit Summary

At the end of each productive chat where files have been modified, Claude will:

1. Provide a recommended commit message following the standard conventions above
2. List all files that have been changed and need to be committed
3. Provide simple instructions for what needs to be done to commit these changes

### Example Commit Summary Format

```
## Commit Summary

feat: add user authentication component

Files to commit:
- web/frontend/src/components/Auth.js (new)
- web/frontend/src/pages/login.js (modified)

To commit these changes:
1. Click the "+" next to each file in the Source Control panel
2. Enter the commit message above in the message box
3. Click "Commit"
4. If prompted to "Save All & Commit Changes", choose this option
```

## Project Structure & Naming Conventions

### Directories and Files
- Use lowercase with hyphens for directories (e.g., `components/auth-form`, `services/video-processing`)
- Use PascalCase for React component files (e.g., `UserLogin.jsx`)
- Use camelCase for utility files (e.g., `apiClient.js`, `videoUtils.js`)
- Use snake_case for Python files in the backend (e.g., `content_retrieval.py`)

### Component Structure
- Structure React components: imports, component, helpers, exports
- Structure Python modules: imports, constants, functions, classes, exports

## Frontend Conventions (Next.js + React)

### React Components
- Use functional components (not class components)
- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility
- Separate UI from business logic when possible
- Use descriptive names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., `isLoading`, `hasError`)

### Styling with Tailwind CSS
- Use Tailwind classes directly in components
- Create reusable UI components for common patterns
- Follow desktop-first design with mobile responsiveness
- Use CSS variables for theme colors and consistent spacing
- Leverage Tailwind's responsive prefixes for adaptive layouts

### Performance Guidelines
- Optimize images for web delivery
- Design for desktop first, but ensure compatibility with mobile devices
- Implement appropriate loading states and fallbacks
- Use code splitting for larger components where appropriate

## Backend Conventions (FastAPI + Python)

### API Design
- Use RESTful principles for endpoint design
- Implement proper status codes and error responses
- Document all endpoints with OpenAPI specifications
- Use async functions for I/O bound operations

### Python Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints for function parameters and return values
- Keep functions concise and single-purpose
- Document functions with docstrings

### Security Practices
- Never expose API keys in frontend code
- Validate all user inputs
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration

## Media Processing Guidelines

### Content Retrieval
- Implement proper error handling for external APIs
- Cache commonly accessed content when appropriate
- Use appropriate timeouts for external requests
- Handle rate limiting gracefully

### Video Generation
- Optimize for quality-to-file-size ratio
- Implement proper progress tracking for long-running processes
- Handle concurrent processing requests efficiently
- Clean up temporary files after processing

## Recommended Development Strategy

You raise a great point about breaking changes into smaller, more manageable tasks. Here's what I recommend:

### 1. Start with Frontend-Backend Integration Issues

I'd recommend tackling the issues in a specific order that makes the most sense for development flow:

1. **Frontend-Backend Integration First**:
   - Start by properly connecting the form submission to the backend
   - This gives you a working end-to-end flow that you can build upon

2. **Backend Environment Configuration**:
   - Fix the environment variables and mock necessary cloud services
   - This ensures backend services work correctly with frontend requests

3. **Frontend UI Improvements**:
   - Complete styling across pages
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Add responsive design

4. **Backend Feature Implementation**:
   - Complete the video processing pipeline
   - Implement authentication

### 2. One Issue at a Time with Regular Commits

For each task:
1. Create a new branch for the feature/fix
2. Make small, testable changes
3. Test each change
4. Commit with descriptive messages using our prefix conventions
5. Merge back to main when complete

This approach has several benefits:
- Each commit represents a working state
- Easier to track progress
- Simpler to debug if issues arise
- Better code organization

### Example Implementation Plan:

Let's break down our next steps with specific tasks and commit points:

#### Task 1: Connect Form Submission to Backend
```
- Create form validation on frontend
- Implement form submission handler
- Connect to backend API endpoint
- Add loading states
- Implement basic error handling
- COMMIT: "feat: connect create video form to backend API"
```

#### Task 2: Fix Environment Variables
```
- Create proper .env.example files
- Implement environment variable checks
- Update mock storage service
- Test with frontend integration
- COMMIT: "fix: implement proper environment variable handling"
```

#### Task 3: Standardize UI Styling
```
- Create consistent component styling
- Update navigation elements
- Fix responsive design issues
- COMMIT: "style: standardize UI components across pages"
```

## About the File Structure Issue

The file structure in the Git panel might look different because:
1. Some files might be ignored by Git (as per .gitignore)
2. The panel shows changes relative to the last commit
3. Cursor IDE might have a different view than the actual file system

You can always use `git ls-files` to see what files Git is tracking:
