# Investigation: Populating R2 Storage Fields in Scene Media

This document summarizes the steps taken while trying to implement and verify the process of storing media in R2 and updating the corresponding scene object with the necessary storage details.

**Primary Goal & Missing Fields:**

The main objective is to ensure that after media associated with a scene is successfully uploaded to Cloudflare R2, the scene's `media` object in the project data (and subsequently in MongoDB) is updated with the following fields:

*   `media.storageKey`: The unique identifier for the object in the R2 bucket.
*   `media.url`: **Updated** to the public access URL for the file stored in R2.
*   `media.thumbnailUrl`: The public URL for the generated thumbnail image (if applicable).
*   `media.isStorageBacked`: A boolean flag set to `true`.
*   `media.storedAt`: A timestamp (e.g., `Date.now()`) indicating when the storage process completed.

Currently, these fields are missing from the scene data because the storage and update process has not yet been successfully completed and verified for the scenes examined.

**Secondary Issue Observed (Scene `updatedAt` Field):**

During the debugging process, it was also noted that another field, `updatedAt`, was consistently missing from the *scene objects themselves* (nested within the project's `scenes` array) in both frontend logs and MongoDB data. 

*   **Purpose of Scene `updatedAt`:** This field is intended to store a timestamp (e.g., `Date.now()`) indicating the last time *that specific scene object* was modified (text edit, media trim, storage info update, etc.).

While important for tracking individual scene modifications, the investigation into *why* this field was missing became a significant distraction from the primary goal of populating the R2 storage fields. It was incorrectly assumed that recent frontend code changes were causing this field to be lost.

**Summary of (Misdirected) Debugging Steps:**

1.  **Initial Frontend Changes:** Modifications were made to `useSceneManagement.ts` primarily aimed at removing legacy `order` logic and fixing timestamp formats (`Date.now()` instead of ISO strings). A linter error related to the `delete` operator was also fixed.
2.  **Focus on `updatedAt`:** Based on observations of logs and MongoDB data showing the scene-level `updatedAt` field was missing, the investigation incorrectly focused on the frontend merge logic within `useSceneManagement.ts` as the potential cause.
3.  **Attempted Frontend Fixes:** Several attempts were made to modify the merge logic in `updateScene` to prevent the perceived loss of the `updatedAt` field.
4.  **Reversion:** When these attempts failed to make the `updatedAt` field appear and caused further confusion, all recent frontend changes were reverted using Git.
5.  **Confirmation:** Even after reverting all frontend changes, the scene-level `updatedAt` field remained absent, confirming it was unrelated to the reverted edits.

**Conclusion on Debugging Path:**

The time spent modifying and reverting the frontend merge logic in pursuit of the missing scene-level `updatedAt` field was based on a misunderstanding. This field's absence is likely a separate, pre-existing issue, possibly related to the backend API, and should be investigated independently if desired. It is **not** the reason the R2 storage fields are missing.

The R2 storage fields (`storageKey`, R2 `url`, `thumbnailUrl`, etc.) are missing simply because the workflow step to populate them (`updateSceneStorageInfo` call followed by `saveProject`) has not yet successfully completed for the scenes being examined.

**Correct Next Steps (Focusing on R2 Fields):**

1.  **Verify Frontend Flow:** Ensure the frontend code correctly:
    *   Receives the `storageKey`, R2 `url`, and `thumbnailUrl` after a successful R2 upload.
    *   Calls `updateSceneStorageInfo(sceneId, storageKey, thumbnailUrl, newR2Url)` with the correct data.
    *   Calls `saveProject(updatedProjectState)` *after* the state has been updated by `updateSceneStorageInfo`.
2.  **Inspect Frontend State:** Add temporary logging *just before* the `saveProject` call in `useProjectPersistence.ts` to explicitly log the `media` object of the relevant scene, confirming it contains the new R2 fields.
3.  **Inspect Backend Payload:** Verify the full PATCH payload logged by `useProjectPersistence.ts` includes the scene with the updated `media` object containing the R2 fields.
4.  **Investigate Backend API (If Necessary):** If steps 1-3 confirm the frontend is sending the correct data, investigate the backend `PATCH /api/v1/projects/{project_id}` endpoint and associated Pydantic models to ensure they correctly process and save the nested `media` object updates, including the new R2 fields.

## Further Investigation: Frontend State Update (Chat Session Summary)

This section summarizes the debugging steps taken during the subsequent chat session after the initial investigation documented above.

**Observations & Backend Fix:**

1.  **Initial Logging:** Added console logs to `useSceneManagement.updateSceneStorageInfo` (inside the function) and `useProjectPersistence.saveProject` (before the PATCH call).
2.  **Log Results 1:** Observed that the `[useProjectPersistence] Payload PRE-SEND` log was showing the scene data *without* the R2 fields. Crucially, the logs *inside* `useSceneManagement.updateSceneStorageInfo` were *not* appearing.
3.  **Hypothesis 1:** Suspected the backend API endpoint called by `storeMediaContent` (in `useMediaStorage.ts`) was not returning the R2 details (`storageKey`, `url`, etc.).
4.  **Backend Verification:** Added logging in `useMediaStorage.ts` around the `storeMediaContent` API call. The log `storeMediaContent response:` confirmed the backend was returning `{success: true, data: {}}` (empty data object).
5.  **Backend Fix:** Identified the issue in `web/backend/app/services/media_service.py`. The `store_media_content` function successfully uploaded to R2 but failed to construct and return the dictionary containing the storage details. Modified this function to correctly return the `storage_key`, R2 `url`, `thumbnail_storage_key`, `thumbnail_url`, etc.
6.  **Backend Fix Confirmation:** After restarting the backend, the `storeMediaContent response:` log now correctly shows the R2 details within the `data` object (e.g., `data: { storage_key: '...', url: '...' }`).

**Frontend State Update Issue:**

7.  **Log Results 2:** Despite the backend fix, the logs *inside* `useSceneManagement.updateSceneStorageInfo` **still did not appear** in the console, even though the log `[useMediaStorage] Dispatched and awaited updateSceneStorageInfo for scene ...` *did* appear (indicating the `await` completed).
8.  **Payload & DB Confirmation:** The `[useProjectPersistence] Payload PRE-SEND` log **still showed the scene missing the R2 fields**. A check of MongoDB confirmed the R2 fields were also missing in the database record.
9.  **Hypothesis 2:** Suspected a frontend timing issue where the auto-save (`useProjectPersistence.saveProject`) was reading the state *before* the update from `updateSceneStorageInfo` took effect, or a more complex React state/hook interaction issue.
10. **Attempted Fixes (Failed):**
    *   Added an explicit `await saveProject(project)` call within `useMediaStorage.ts` after awaiting `updateSceneStorageInfo`. (Result: Payload still missing R2 fields. Change reverted.)
    *   Removed the `useCallback` wrapper from `updateSceneStorageInfo` in `useSceneManagement.ts`. (Result: Internal logs still missing.)
    *   Drastically simplified `updateSceneStorageInfo` to a single `console.log`. (Result: Log still missing. Simplification reverted.)
    *   Added `useCallback` and `useMemo` in `ProjectProvider.tsx` to stabilize function references. (Result: Caused linter errors, difficult to resolve cleanly. Change reverted.)
    *   Added a `try...catch` block inside `updateSceneStorageInfo`. (Result: No "CRITICAL ERROR" log appeared.)

**Current Conclusion:**

*   The backend API now correctly returns R2 storage details.
*   The frontend `useMediaStorage` hook receives these details.
*   The frontend calls `await updateSceneStorageInfo(...)`.
*   The `await` completes successfully.
*   However, the code *inside* the `updateSceneStorageInfo` function body (in `useSceneManagement.ts`) does not appear to execute (no logs, even a single one, appear from within it).
*   Consequently, the React state is not updated with the R2 details before `useProjectPersistence.saveProject` reads the state, leading to the R2 fields being missing in the saved payload and the database.
*   The root cause seems to be a subtle issue with React's state updates, context propagation, or hook interactions, preventing the called function's body from executing as expected.

**Next Proposed Step:** Refactor the state update flow to be more direct, likely involving changes to `useSceneManagement.ts`, `useMediaStorage.ts`, and potentially `ProjectReducer.ts`.

## Further Investigation 2: Project State Null Check

Based on the previous conclusion that the `updateSceneStorageInfo` function body wasn't executing, we attempted a different approach:

1.  **Direct Update via `saveProject`:** Modified `useMediaStorage.ts` to get the `project` state and `saveProject` function from context. The plan was to bypass `updateSceneStorageInfo` and call `saveProject` directly after the backend returned R2 details.
2.  **Initial Test Failure:** The first test with this approach showed `[useMediaStorage] Project state is null. Cannot save scene ... details.` in the console. This indicated the `project` state was null *after* the API call returned.
3.  **Revised Direct Update:** Added a null check for `project` *before* the API call within the `storeMedia` function in `useMediaStorage.ts` to prevent attempting storage if the project wasn't loaded.
4.  **Test Result (Project Null):** Triggering the "store media" action again resulted in the console log: `[useMediaStorage] Project is null when trying to store media. Aborting.`

**Current Conclusion (Project Timing):**

*   The root cause of the immediate problem is that the `storeMedia` function (triggered by the UI) is being executed *before* the `project` state has been loaded and populated in the `ProjectContext`.
*   When `useMediaStorage` obtains the `project` from `useProject()`, it's receiving `null` because the data isn't ready yet.

**Next Proposed Step (UI Guard):** Prevent the UI element (e.g., button) that triggers the `storeMedia` action from being interactive until the `project` state in the context is confirmed to be loaded (i.e., not null).
