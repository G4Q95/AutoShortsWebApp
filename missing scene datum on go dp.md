# Investigation: Populating R2 Storage Fields in Scene Media

This document summarizes the steps taken while trying to implement and verify the process of storing media in R2 and updating the corresponding scene object with the necessary storage details.

**Primary Goal & Missing Fields:**

The main objective is to ensure that after media associated with a scene is successfully uploaded to Cloudflare R2, the scene's `media` object in the project data (and subsequently in MongoDB) is updated with the following fields:

*   `media.storageKey`: The unique identifier for the object in the R2 bucket.
*   `media.url`: **Updated** to the public access URL for the file stored in R2.
*   `media.thumbnailUrl`: The public URL for the generated thumbnail image (if applicable).
*   `media.isStorageBacked`: A boolean flag set to `true`.
*   `media.storedAt`: A timestamp (e.g., `Date.now()`) indicating when the storage process completed.

Currently, these fields are missing from the scene data because the storage and update process has not yet been successfully completed and verified for the scenes examined.

**Secondary Issue Observed (Scene `updatedAt` Field):**

During the debugging process, it was also noted that another field, `updatedAt`, was consistently missing from the *scene objects themselves* (nested within the project's `scenes` array) in both frontend logs and MongoDB data. 

*   **Purpose of Scene `updatedAt`:** This field is intended to store a timestamp (e.g., `Date.now()`) indicating the last time *that specific scene object* was modified (text edit, media trim, storage info update, etc.).

While important for tracking individual scene modifications, the investigation into *why* this field was missing became a significant distraction from the primary goal of populating the R2 storage fields. It was incorrectly assumed that recent frontend code changes were causing this field to be lost.

**Summary of (Misdirected) Debugging Steps:**

1.  **Initial Frontend Changes:** Modifications were made to `useSceneManagement.ts` primarily aimed at removing legacy `order` logic and fixing timestamp formats (`Date.now()` instead of ISO strings). A linter error related to the `delete` operator was also fixed.
2.  **Focus on `updatedAt`:** Based on observations of logs and MongoDB data showing the scene-level `updatedAt` field was missing, the investigation incorrectly focused on the frontend merge logic within `useSceneManagement.ts` as the potential cause.
3.  **Attempted Frontend Fixes:** Several attempts were made to modify the merge logic in `updateScene` to prevent the perceived loss of the `updatedAt` field.
4.  **Reversion:** When these attempts failed to make the `updatedAt` field appear and caused further confusion, all recent frontend changes were reverted using Git.
5.  **Confirmation:** Even after reverting all frontend changes, the scene-level `updatedAt` field remained absent, confirming it was unrelated to the reverted edits.

**Conclusion on Debugging Path:**

The time spent modifying and reverting the frontend merge logic in pursuit of the missing scene-level `updatedAt` field was based on a misunderstanding. This field's absence is likely a separate, pre-existing issue, possibly related to the backend API, and should be investigated independently if desired. It is **not** the reason the R2 storage fields are missing.

The R2 storage fields (`storageKey`, R2 `url`, `thumbnailUrl`, etc.) are missing simply because the workflow step to populate them (`updateSceneStorageInfo` call followed by `saveProject`) has not yet successfully completed for the scenes being examined.

**Correct Next Steps (Focusing on R2 Fields):**

1.  **Verify Frontend Flow:** Ensure the frontend code correctly:
    *   Receives the `storageKey`, R2 `url`, and `thumbnailUrl` after a successful R2 upload.
    *   Calls `updateSceneStorageInfo(sceneId, storageKey, thumbnailUrl, newR2Url)` with the correct data.
    *   Calls `saveProject(updatedProjectState)` *after* the state has been updated by `updateSceneStorageInfo`.
2.  **Inspect Frontend State:** Add temporary logging *just before* the `saveProject` call in `useProjectPersistence.ts` to explicitly log the `media` object of the relevant scene, confirming it contains the new R2 fields.
3.  **Inspect Backend Payload:** Verify the full PATCH payload logged by `useProjectPersistence.ts` includes the scene with the updated `media` object containing the R2 fields.
4.  **Investigate Backend API (If Necessary):** If steps 1-3 confirm the frontend is sending the correct data, investigate the backend `PATCH /api/v1/projects/{project_id}` endpoint and associated Pydantic models to ensure they correctly process and save the nested `media` object updates, including the new R2 fields.
