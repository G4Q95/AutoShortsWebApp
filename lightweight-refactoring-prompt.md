- Made tests more robust against UI structure changes
- Fixed media content verification in tests
- All tests passing (6/6 successful)

âœ… Code Organization and Cleanup
- Created dedicated utility files for different concerns:
  - media-utils.ts for media-related functions
  - validation-utils.ts for form and URL validation
  - form-types.ts for form-related types
- Removed duplicate code and consolidated utilities
- Improved code maintainability with better organization
- All tests passing after refactoring
- Added comprehensive JSDoc documentation to ErrorDisplay component
- Added documentation to VideoStatusIndicator component with known issues noted
- Standardized API response formats

### Current Focus
ðŸ”„ Video Processing Pipeline
- Implement video segment processing
- Add progress tracking
- Create video assembly logic
- Implement error handling for processing

ðŸ”„ Production Deployment Configuration
- Extend Docker configuration for production
- Set up CI/CD pipeline
- Create deployment scripts
- Implement proper environment configuration

### Next Steps
1. Complete Video Processing Pipeline
   - Implement video segment processing
   - Add progress tracking
   - Create video assembly logic
   - Add error handling for processing

2. Enhance User Experience
   - Add loading states for all operations
   - Improve error messages
   - Add progress indicators
   - Implement retry mechanisms

3. Add Authentication
   - Implement Google OAuth
   - Add user sessions
   - Create user profiles
   - Add role-based access

## Implementation Guidelines
- Keep changes minimal and focused
- Maintain existing functionality
- Improve code reliability
- Reduce technical debt gradually
- Test thoroughly after each change
- Do not commit unstable code

## Timeline
- Day 1: âœ… Initial assessment and planning
- Day 2: âœ… Content extraction and error handling fixes
- Day 3: âœ… Frontend state management and API connectivity
- Day 4: âœ… Test suite reliability improvements
- Day 5: âœ… Code organization and API standardization
- Day 6: âœ… Docker implementation for consistent environment
- Day 7: ðŸ”„ Video processing pipeline implementation

## Success Metrics
