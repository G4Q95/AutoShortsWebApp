# Auto Shorts Web App - Lightweight Refactoring Plan

## Progress Update - Day 5

### Completed Tasks
✅ Content Extraction and Error Handling
- Simplified Reddit API interaction
- Removed complex retry logic
- Improved error feedback
- Fixed backend server configuration
- Enhanced frontend error display

✅ Frontend State Management (Partial)
- Fixed context provider architecture
- Improved type exports and imports
- Fixed project context nesting issues
- Resolved state management in project workspace
- Corrected API response handling

✅ API Connectivity
- Fixed backend API URL configuration
- Resolved connectivity issues between frontend and backend
- Implemented proper environment variable handling
- Added missing extractContent implementation

✅ Test Suite Improvements
- Fixed E2E tests with proper DOM selectors
- Implemented resilient element selection strategies
- Added comprehensive fallback approaches for UI interactions
- Enhanced test debugging with screenshots and logs
- Made tests more robust against UI structure changes
- Fixed media content verification in tests

✅ Code Organization and Cleanup (Partial)
- Created dedicated utility files for different concerns:
  - media-utils.ts for media-related functions
  - validation-utils.ts for form and URL validation
  - form-types.ts for form-related types
- Removed duplicate code and consolidated utilities
- Improved code maintainability with better organization
- All tests passing after refactoring

### Current Focus
🔄 API Standardization
- Create consistent error format
- Implement proper status codes
- Add detailed error messages
- Standardize error handling

### Next Steps
1. Complete API Standardization
   - Create standardized error response format
   - Implement consistent status codes
   - Add detailed error messages
   - Create common error handling utilities

2. Complete Code Organization
   - Document shared components
   - Add JSDoc comments to utility functions
   - Create API documentation
   - Update component documentation

3. Address Console Errors
   - Investigate and fix message channel closure errors
   - Implement proper cleanup for async operations
   - Add error boundaries where needed

## Implementation Guidelines
- Keep changes minimal and focused
- Maintain existing functionality
- Improve code reliability
- Reduce technical debt gradually
- Test thoroughly after each change
- Do not commit unstable code

## Timeline
- Day 1: ✅ Initial assessment and planning
