# Auto Shorts Web App - Lightweight Refactoring Plan

## Progress Update - Day 3

### Completed Tasks
✅ Content Extraction and Error Handling
- Simplified Reddit API interaction
- Removed complex retry logic
- Improved error feedback
- Fixed backend server configuration
- Enhanced frontend error display

✅ Frontend State Management (Partial)
- Fixed context provider architecture
- Improved type exports and imports
- Fixed project context nesting issues
- Resolved state management in project workspace
- Corrected API response handling

✅ API Connectivity
- Fixed backend API URL configuration
- Resolved connectivity issues between frontend and backend
- Implemented proper environment variable handling

✅ Test Suite Improvements
- Fixed E2E tests with proper DOM selectors
- Implemented resilient element selection strategies
- Added comprehensive fallback approaches for UI interactions
- Enhanced test debugging with screenshots and logs
- Made tests more robust against UI structure changes

### Current Focus
🔄 Frontend State Management (Remaining)
- Reduce unnecessary re-renders
- Implement consistent loading states
- Improve performance with memoization

🔄 API Standardization
- Create consistent error format
- Implement proper status codes
- Add detailed error messages
- Standardize error handling

### Next Steps
1. Complete Frontend State Management
   - Add loading indicators with proper states
   - Optimize component rendering with useMemo/useCallback
   - Review and refine error handling UX
   - Improve performance for large project lists

2. API Standardization and Error Handling
   - Create standardized error response format
   - Implement consistent status codes across all endpoints
   - Add detailed error messages and codes
   - Create common error handling utilities

3. Code Organization
   - Move common utilities to shared location
   - Standardize imports and exports
   - Clean up unused code
   - Organize related functionality

4. Testing Improvements
   - Add critical path tests
   - Create test utilities for common operations
   - Implement proper mocking for API responses
   - Add integration tests for key workflows

## Implementation Guidelines
- Keep changes minimal and focused
- Maintain existing functionality
- Improve code reliability
- Reduce technical debt gradually
- Test thoroughly after each change
- Do not commit unstable code

## Timeline
- Day 1: ✅ Initial assessment and planning
- Day 2: ✅ Content extraction and error handling fixes
- Day 3: ✅ Frontend state management and API connectivity
- Day 3: ✅ Test suite reliability improvements
