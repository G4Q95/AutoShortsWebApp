# Lightweight Refactoring Implementation Guide

I'm working on the Auto Shorts Web App project, a Next.js and FastAPI application that's in the early stages of development. I've created a dedicated Git branch called `lightweight-refactoring` for making code improvements without disrupting ongoing feature development.

Please help me implement the lightweight refactoring plan as detailed in our `2024-05-19-Code-Cleanup-Refactoring.md` document. We'll be focusing on the "Lightweight Implementation Plan" section, which outlines a 4-week plan with specific tasks and safety measures.

## Key Information

- We're in the early stages of development (only a few days in)
- The site currently has basic functionality but is growing quickly
- We want to establish good patterns early without a massive overhaul
- We need to minimize risk of breaking existing functionality
- The plan focuses on high-impact, low-risk improvements

## Current Approach

Please guide me through implementing the Week 1 tasks first:

1. Setup linting & formatting tools (Days 1-2)
2. Remove redundant files (Day 3)
3. Document current patterns (Days 4-5)

For each task:
- Explain what we're doing and why
- Show the specific steps to implement the changes
- Provide the exact code/configuration changes needed
- Explain how to test the changes before committing
- Help create clear commit messages for each step

## Safety Precautions

As we implement these changes:
- Verify each change individually before proceeding to the next
- Make sure we back up any critical files before modifying them
- Keep changes small and focused
- Test thoroughly after each change
- Be ready to revert if anything breaks

Let's start with the first task: setting up linting and formatting tools. Can you guide me through the process of adding ESLint and Prettier to the Auto Shorts Web App project?
