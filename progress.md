# Auto Shorts Web App - Development Progress

## Current Development Focus

The current focus is on improving code stability, API connectivity, and refactoring the state management:

### Completed Tasks
- âœ… Fixed the Not-Found page component error
- âœ… Enhanced Reddit content extraction to properly handle redirects and fetch media
- âœ… Added project name input step for video creation
- âœ… Implemented MongoDB Atlas integration for project storage
- âœ… Created project workspace with responsive grid layout
- âœ… Implemented drag-and-drop scene reordering with @hello-pangea/dnd
- âœ… Built scene components that properly display various media types (images, videos, galleries)
- âœ… Added project listing page with creation date and deletion options
- âœ… Implemented proper error handling for content extraction failures
- âœ… Fixed Project Context architecture to ensure proper wrapping of components
- âœ… Added missing Provider in project ID page to fix "useProject must be used within Provider" error
- âœ… Resolved API connectivity by fixing backend URL configuration
- âœ… Implemented missing extractContent function in api-client for proper content extraction
- âœ… Optimized ProjectProvider to reduce unnecessary re-renders with proper memoization
- âœ… Created standardized error handling utilities for frontend and backend
- âœ… Implemented consistent UI components for loading states and error displays
- âœ… Enhanced API client with improved error formatting and logging

### In Progress
- ðŸ”„ Lightweight code refactoring to improve maintainability:
  - Organizing common utilities across the application
  - Reducing technical debt in components
  
- ðŸ”„ Implementing end-to-end video processing pipeline:
  - Setting up backend FFMPEG integration for video segment creation
  - Developing scene-to-video segment conversion process
  - Creating video assembly with transition effects
  - Building API endpoints for video processing status updates
  
- ðŸ”„ Enhancing project workspace UI:
  - Adding text editing capabilities for scene content
  - Implementing media trimming and cropping controls
  - Creating more visual feedback during drag operations
  - Adding thumbnail previews to projects list

## Checkpoint: "project-workspace-functionality-complete"

This checkpoint marks the completion of the core project workspace functionality, enabling users to create projects, add content from Reddit, and organize scenes.

### What We've Accomplished:

1. **Project Management**:
   - âœ… Create projects with custom titles
   - âœ… Save projects to MongoDB for persistence
   - âœ… List all projects with creation dates
   - âœ… Delete unwanted projects
   - âœ… Access existing projects for continued editing

2. **Content Organization**:
   - âœ… Extract content from Reddit URLs including media and text
   - âœ… Display media properly based on type (image, video, gallery)
   - âœ… Show text content with source attribution
   - âœ… Organize content in responsive grid layout
   - âœ… Reorder scenes via intuitive drag-and-drop

3. **Backend Infrastructure**:
   - âœ… MongoDB integration with proper data models
   - âœ… Fallback to mock database when MongoDB unavailable
   - âœ… API endpoints for all project operations
   - âœ… Reddit content extraction with redirect handling

## Timeline Status

We are in Phase 2 of the project, focused on connecting the frontend workspace to backend processing. We have completed approximately 70% of this phase:

- âœ… Content extraction from Reddit is fully functional
- âœ… Project workspace UI is complete with scene organization
- âœ… MongoDB integration for project persistence is working
- ðŸ”„ Video processing pipeline is partially implemented (40%)
- ðŸ”„ Advanced UI features for content editing are in early stages

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Video Processing Pipeline**:
   - Implement FFMPEG integration for video generation
   - Create scene-to-video segment conversion logic
   - Build video assembly with transitions
   - Add voiceover generation via ElevenLabs
   - Implement progress tracking with websocket updates

2. **Enhance Content Editing**:
   - Add text editing capabilities for scenes
   - Implement media trimming and cropping controls
   - Create bulk import functionality for multiple URLs
   - Add retry mechanisms for failed content extraction

3. **Improve User Experience**:
   - Add confirmation dialogs before destructive actions (deletion of projects/scenes)
   - Implement skeleton UI placeholders during content loading
   - Create thumbnail previews in projects list (gallery view)
   - Add loading indicators with progress percentage

4. **User Authentication & Personalization**:
   - Implement Google OAuth integration
   - Add user-specific project storage
   - Create user profile and preferences
   - Implement role-based feature access (free vs. premium)

## Known Issues & Technical Debt

- Reddit content extraction occasionally fails with certain URL formats
- Project state management in ProjectProvider is overly complex and could be refactored
- Large projects with many scenes experience performance slowdowns
- No offline capability when MongoDB connection fails
- Video processing lacks proper error handling and retry mechanisms
