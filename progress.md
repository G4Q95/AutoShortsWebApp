## Checkpoint: "project-workspace-functionality-complete"

This checkpoint marks the completion of the core project workspace functionality, enabling users to create projects, add content from Reddit, and organize scenes.

### What We've Accomplished:

1. **Project Management**:
   - âœ… Create projects with custom titles
   - âœ… Save projects to MongoDB for persistence
   - âœ… List all projects with creation dates
   - âœ… Delete unwanted projects
   - âœ… Access existing projects for continued editing

2. **Content Organization**:
   - âœ… Extract content from Reddit URLs including media and text
   - âœ… Display media properly based on type (image, video, gallery)
   - âœ… Show text content with source attribution
   - âœ… Organize content in responsive grid layout
   - âœ… Reorder scenes via intuitive drag-and-drop

3. **Backend Infrastructure**:
   - âœ… MongoDB integration with proper data models
   - âœ… Fallback to mock database when MongoDB unavailable
   - âœ… API endpoints for all project operations
   - âœ… Reddit content extraction with redirect handling

4. **Testing**:
   - âœ… Core functionality E2E tests cover:
     - Home page navigation
     - Project creation
     - Scene addition
     - Scene reordering
     - Scene deletion
   - âœ… Tests implemented with resilient selectors and fallback approaches
   - âœ… Detailed logging and screenshots for better debugging

## Timeline Status

We are in Phase 2 of the project, focused on connecting the frontend workspace to backend processing. We have completed approximately 70% of this phase:

- âœ… Content extraction from Reddit is fully functional
- âœ… Project workspace UI is complete with scene organization
- âœ… MongoDB integration for project persistence is working
- âœ… Comprehensive E2E tests for core functionality are implemented
- ðŸ”„ Video processing pipeline is partially implemented (40%)

   - Create thumbnail previews in projects list (gallery view)
   - Add loading indicators with progress percentage

4. **User Authentication & Personalization**:
