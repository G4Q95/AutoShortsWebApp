**Project Status:** Stable / Feature Development (Video Generation - Phase 3)
**Current Focus:** Resuming Video Generation features on stable commit `d782e56`.
**Current Stable Commit:** `d782e56` ("All Working!")

---

## Overall Progress

*   **Frontend Setup (Next.js, Tailwind):** 95% (Core setup complete, styling ongoing)
*   **Backend API (FastAPI):** 85% (Core endpoints done, R2 logic refactoring in progress)
*   **Database (MongoDB):** 90% (Models defined, R2 tracking added)
*   **Content Retrieval:** 80% (Reddit implemented, needs robust error handling)

*   **R2 Storage Integration:** 80% (Uploads working, cleanup refactoring in progress)
*   **Docker Setup:** 85% (Services running, backend image needs cleanup)
*   **Testing (Playwright):** 75% (All 10 E2E tests passing on `d782e56`. Cleanup handled manually.)
*   **UI/UX:** 70% (Basic layout, needs refinement)

---

## Completed Milestones (Recent First)

*   **March 30:**
    *   **Achieved Stable State:** Identified commit `d782e56` ("All Working!") as stable base where all E2E tests pass.
    *   **R2 Purge Confirmed:** Successfully ran the `r2_purger.py` script to empty the bucket.
    *   **(Reverted) Debug Test Cleanup Attempts:** Reverted recent attempts to implement automated test cleanup in Playwright due to unexpected test failures.
*   **June 2024:**
    *   **Fixed Cloudflare R2 Authentication Issues:** Diagnosed and resolved 401 Unauthorized errors when accessing the R2 bucket
    *   **Updated R2 credentials in both root and backend .env files with valid API token**
    *   **Verified successful uploads and storage operations through backend logs**
    *   **Ensured proper initialization of the R2 client in the application**
    *   **Rebuilt Docker containers to properly apply updated environment variables**
    *   **Created standalone `r2_purger.py` script for bulk cleaning of R2 bucket**
*   **March 29, 2025:**
    *   **Fixed R2 File Deletion (Bug):** Identified and fixed incorrect `async`/`await` usage with synchronous boto3 S3 client.
    *   **Corrected return type handling in debug endpoints (`test_delete_sync`, `test_upload`).**
    *   **Fixed `list_project_files` to use correct loop for paginator.**
    *   **Updated `verify_cleanup` endpoint for better accuracy.**
    *   **Corrected `settings.r2_bucket_name` typo to `settings.R2_BUCKET_NAME` in the pattern-based deletion fallback within `project.py`'s `cleanup_project_storage` function.**
    *   **Current Strategy:** Backend uses S3 API directly. Primary: Database tracked files. Fallback: Pattern matching. Worker/Wrangler are not the active methods.**

## In Progress / Next Steps

1.  **Video Voice Generation:**
    *   **Status:** Active.
    *   **Goal:** Integrate ElevenLabs API for voice generation based on scene text. Add UI elements for voice selection and preview.
2.  **Video Preview & Customization:**
    *   **Status:** Next Up.
    *   **Goal:** Implement the `/projects/{id}/preview` route. Allow users to customize scene timings, potentially visuals, and preview the final video sequence.
3.  **(Future) Re-evaluate Test Cleanup Strategy:**
    *   **Status:** On Hold.
    *   **Goal:** Develop a reliable and non-interfering method to clean up test-generated projects and R2 files after Playwright runs. Current method: Manual execution of `r2_purger.py`.
4.  **(Future) R2 Refactoring:**
    *   **Status:** On Hold. (See `docs/R2-Refactoring-Plan.md`)
    *   **Goal:** Simplify and clean up R2 interaction code, remove unused config/code.

---

## Known Issues / Blockers

*   **(Minor) Browser Console Errors:** Some persistent errors (CORS, NaN, VideoContext init) noted during test runs - investigate later.
*   **(Deferred) Test Cleanup Automation:** No automated cleanup after tests. Requires manual `r2_purger.py` execution.

## 2023-11-07

- Created initial project setup with Next.js, FastAPI, MongoDB
- Added Docker configuration
- Set up basic user authentication
- Implemented API endpoints for project creation, project listing

## 2023-11-08

- Added file upload to Cloudflare R2
- Created media processing pipeline
- Added thumbnail generation
- Improved project management UI
- Setup basic project settings page

## 2023-11-09

- Fixed issue with R2 file deletion where files weren't being properly deleted 
- Root cause: incorrectly using `await` with boto3 S3 client methods, which are synchronous
- Created detailed documentation of the fix in docs/R2-Deletion-Fix.md
- Fixed issues with async/await usage in storage operations
- Added debug endpoint to test file creation and deletion 

### In Progress (Current Focus)

- **Refactor R2 Deletion Logic (Future):** Plan a refactoring session to clean up the R2 deletion code, potentially consolidating strategies and removing redundant debug code.

### Completed Tasks

*   **Fix R2 File Deletion (Bug)** - Status: âœ… Complete (March 29, 2025)
    *   Identified and fixed incorrect `async`/`await` usage with synchronous boto3 S3 client.
    *   Corrected return type handling in debug endpoints (`test_delete_sync`, `test_upload`).
    *   Fixed `list_project_files` to use correct loop for paginator.
    *   Updated `verify_cleanup` endpoint for better accuracy.
    *   **Final Fix:** Corrected `settings.r2_bucket_name` typo to `settings.R2_BUCKET_NAME` in the pattern-based deletion fallback within `project.py`'s `cleanup_project_storage` function.
    *   **Current Strategy:** Backend uses S3 API directly. Primary: Database tracked files. Fallback: Pattern matching. Worker/Wrangler are not the active methods.

## Progress Update (YYYY-MM-DD)

**Test Suite Status:**
- âœ… All 10 Playwright E2E tests passing (`NEXT_PUBLIC_MOCK_AUDIO=true npm test`).
- ðŸŸ¡ Some browser console errors persist (CORS, NaN, VideoContext init) - need investigation later.

**Current Focus:**
- Backend Refactoring (R2 Cleanup Logic) & Test Environment Improvement.

**Completed Tasks:**
- âœ… Fixed Playwright test failures (`project-management.spec.ts`, `scene-operations.spec.ts`).
- âœ… Refactor: Removed unused debug endpoints (`verify_wrangler_auth`, `verify_r2_access`, etc.) from `web/backend/app/api/debug.py`.
- âœ… Refactor: Removed unused Cloudflare env vars (`CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`, `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`) from `docker-compose.yml`.
- âœ… Backend: Added debug endpoint `/api/v1/debug/cleanup-test-data` to delete test projects by prefix.

**In Progress:**
- **Robust Playwright Cleanup:**
    - Backend endpoint created.
    - *Paused:* Implementing `afterAll` hook in Playwright tests (`project-management.spec.ts`) to call the backend cleanup endpoint.

**Next Steps:**
1.  Implement `afterAll` hook in `project-management.spec.ts` to call `/api/v1/debug/cleanup-test-data`.
2.  Refactor: Clean up `web/backend/Dockerfile` by removing Node.js/Wrangler install steps.
3.  Continue with R2 Refactoring Plan (Step 5 - Core Logic).
4.  Investigate remaining browser console errors (post-refactoring).

**Implementation Plan Status:**
*   **Phase 1: Core Setup & Project Management (95% Complete)**
    *   Frontend: Basic structure, project list, creation form (Done)

### Blockers
- None currently.

### Notes
- Prioritizing backend refactoring before addressing minor console errors unless they block functionality.
- Need to ensure R2 cleanup works reliably after tests.
