### In Progress (Estimate: 35% complete)

*   **Scene Management & Media Handling (50%):**
    *   [x] Basic scene creation from URL
    *   [x] Fetching content (text, media URL)
    *   [x] Basic media display (image/video)
    *   [x] Storing media in R2 (Backend complete, Frontend integration ongoing)
    *   [ ] Scene reordering (UI implemented, backend API exists, needs connection)
    *   [x] Scene deletion (UI/Backend connected)
    *   [x] Audio Generation (ElevenLabs API integration)
    *   [x] Audio Playback
    *   [ ] Audio Storage in R2 (Backend endpoint exists, needs frontend integration)
    *   [x] Video Trimming (UI controls implemented, API connected, persistence fixed)
    *   [ ] Synchronized Playback (Audio + Video/Image)
*   **UI Enhancements (20%):**
    *   [x] Basic project list and creation UI
    *   [x] Scene card layout
    *   [ ] Improved loading states and error handling
    *   [ ] Responsive design improvements
    *   [ ] Consistent UI components (using Shadcn/ui)
*   **Testing (15%):**
    *   [x] Basic Playwright setup
    *   [ ] E2E tests for core features (project creation, scene addition, media trimming)

### Completed Tasks

- **Task 1: Initial Project Setup & API Foundation** (Completed)
- **Task 2: Core Content Processing & Scene Management** (Partially Completed - Media Download Refactored)
  - Subtask 2.1: Define Project/Scene Models (Completed)
  - Subtask 2.2: Implement Project CRUD API (Completed)
  - Subtask 2.3: Implement Scene Add/Update/Delete API (Completed)
  - Subtask 2.4: ~~Implement FFmpeg Audio Extraction Service~~ (Cancelled - Replaced by 2.14)
  - Subtask 2.5: ~~Integrate Audio Extraction into Scene Creation~~ (Cancelled - Replaced by 2.15)
  - Subtask 2.6: Implement Content Retrieval Service (Completed)
  - Subtask 2.7: Add URL Preview Endpoint (Completed)
  - Subtask 2.8: Integrate Content Retrieval into Scene Creation (Completed)
  - Subtask 2.9: ~~Error Handling for Media Download~~ (Cancelled - Handled in 2.14)
  - Subtask 2.10: ~~Enqueue Audio Extraction Task~~ (Cancelled - Replaced by 2.15)
  - **Subtask 2.14: Define Celery Task for yt-dlp Download** (Completed)
  - **Subtask 2.15: Modify Service to Enqueue yt-dlp Download Task** (Completed)
- **Task 3: Voice Generation Service** (Completed)
- **Task 4: Frontend Project Workspace** (Completed)
- **Task 5: Frontend Scene Editor UI** (Completed)
- **Task 6: Integrate Backend Services with Frontend** (Completed)
- **Task 7: User Authentication** (Completed)
- **Task 8: Deployment Setup (Initial)** (Completed)
- **Task 9: FFmpeg Service Containerization** (Completed)
- **Task 10: Implement Celery for Background Audio Extraction** (Partially Completed - Refactored for Media Download)

**Architecture Note:** Implemented background task processing using Celery and Redis. Media downloading from URLs is now handled asynchronously by a Celery worker using `yt-dlp`, triggered via the backend API.

### Next Steps

- **Task 11: Implement yt-dlp Media Download Service** (Review and potentially adapt existing subtasks based on recent Celery implementation)
- **Task 12 (New): Update Project Documentation** (Reflect Celery, Redis, Docker structure, yt-dlp changes)
- Refine error handling and user feedback for background tasks.
- Implement remaining features (e.g., video generation, advanced editing).
- Enhance testing (revisit unit tests, add more integration tests).
