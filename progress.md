# Project Progress

## Overview
This document tracks the development progress of the Auto Shorts Web App.

## Current Implementation Status (Approximate)
- **Core Functionality:** 75%
- **UI/UX:** 70%
- **Testing:** 60% (E2E tests written, but blocked by DB issue)
- **Deployment Setup:** 40%

## Completed Tasks
- **[Date TBD]** Fixed R2 authentication issues.
- **[Date TBD]** Resolved R2 file deletion problems.
- **[Date TBD]** Implemented core project creation and media upload functionality.
- **[Date TBD]** Set up basic Docker environment for frontend and backend.
- **[Date TBD]** Integrated basic ElevenLabs API for audio generation (mockable).
- **[Date TBD]** Added Playwright E2E test suite structure.
- **[March 30, 2024]** Implemented alternative test cleanup mechanism using a separate Node.js script and name-pattern matching in the backend API.
- **[March 30, 2024]** Added NPM scripts for running tests and cleanup (`cleanup`, `test-and-cleanup`).
- **[March 30, 2024]** Documented the new test cleanup process.

## In Progress
- **Debugging MongoDB Connection:** Investigating and fixing the MongoDB URI configuration error that forces the backend into mock database mode.

## Next Steps
1.  **Resolve MongoDB Connection:** Fix the configuration error preventing a real database connection.
2.  **Verify Test Suite:** Run the full Playwright test suite against the real database to ensure tests pass.
3.  **Verify Cleanup:** Confirm the `npm run cleanup` script successfully deletes test projects and associated R2 files using the real database connection.
4.  **Continue R2 Refactoring:** Proceed with the steps outlined in `docs/R2-Refactoring-Plan.md` (e.g., removing unused debug endpoints).
5.  **UI/UX Refinements:** Address UI feedback and improve user flows.

## Blockers
- **MongoDB Connection Issue:** The primary blocker preventing further testing and full verification of features like content processing and cleanup.

## 2023-11-07

- Created initial project setup with Next.js, FastAPI, MongoDB
- Added Docker configuration
- Set up basic user authentication
- Implemented API endpoints for project creation, project listing

## 2023-11-08

- Added file upload to Cloudflare R2
- Created media processing pipeline
- Added thumbnail generation
- Improved project management UI
- Setup basic project settings page

## 2023-11-09

- Fixed issue with R2 file deletion where files weren't being properly deleted 
- Root cause: incorrectly using `await` with boto3 S3 client methods, which are synchronous
- Created detailed documentation of the fix in docs/R2-Deletion-Fix.md
- Fixed issues with async/await usage in storage operations
- Added debug endpoint to test file creation and deletion 

### In Progress (Current Focus)

- **Refactor R2 Deletion Logic (Future):** Plan a refactoring session to clean up the R2 deletion code, potentially consolidating strategies and removing redundant debug code.

### Completed Tasks

*   **Fix R2 File Deletion (Bug)** - Status: âœ… Complete (March 29, 2025)
    *   Identified and fixed incorrect `async`/`await` usage with synchronous boto3 S3 client.
    *   Corrected return type handling in debug endpoints (`test_delete_sync`, `test_upload`).
    *   Fixed `list_project_files` to use correct loop for paginator.
    *   Updated `verify_cleanup` endpoint for better accuracy.
    *   **Final Fix:** Corrected `settings.r2_bucket_name` typo to `settings.R2_BUCKET_NAME` in the pattern-based deletion fallback within `project.py`'s `cleanup_project_storage` function.
    *   **Current Strategy:** Backend uses S3 API directly. Primary: Database tracked files. Fallback: Pattern matching. Worker/Wrangler are not the active methods. 
- âœ… Fixed Cloudflare R2 Authentication Issues (June 2024)
  - Diagnosed and resolved 401 Unauthorized errors when accessing the R2 bucket
  - Updated R2 credentials in both root and backend .env files with valid API token
  - Verified successful uploads and storage operations through backend logs
  - Ensured proper initialization of the R2 client in the application
  - Rebuilt Docker containers to properly apply updated environment variables
  - Created standalone `r2_purger.py` script for bulk cleaning of R2 bucket
- âœ… Fixed the Not-Found page component error

## Progress Update (YYYY-MM-DD)

**Test Suite Status:**
- âœ… All 10 Playwright E2E tests passing (`NEXT_PUBLIC_MOCK_AUDIO=true npm test`).
- ðŸŸ¡ Some browser console errors persist (CORS, NaN, VideoContext init) - need investigation later.

**Current Focus:**
- Backend Refactoring (R2 Cleanup Logic) & Test Environment Improvement.

**Completed Tasks:**
- âœ… Fixed Playwright test failures (`project-management.spec.ts`, `scene-operations.spec.ts`).
- âœ… Refactor: Removed unused debug endpoints (`verify_wrangler_auth`, `verify_r2_access`, etc.) from `web/backend/app/api/debug.py`.
- âœ… Refactor: Removed unused Cloudflare env vars (`CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`, `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`) from `docker-compose.yml`.
- âœ… Backend: Added debug endpoint `/api/v1/debug/cleanup-test-data` to delete test projects by prefix.

**In Progress:**
- **Robust Playwright Cleanup:**
    - Backend endpoint created.
    - *Paused:* Implementing `afterAll` hook in Playwright tests (`project-management.spec.ts`) to call the backend cleanup endpoint.

**Next Steps:**
1.  Implement `afterAll` hook in `project-management.spec.ts` to call `/api/v1/debug/cleanup-test-data`.
2.  Refactor: Clean up `web/backend/Dockerfile` by removing Node.js/Wrangler install steps.
3.  Continue with R2 Refactoring Plan (Step 5 - Core Logic).
4.  Investigate remaining browser console errors (post-refactoring).

**Implementation Plan Status:**
*   **Frontend Setup (Next.js, Tailwind):** 95% (Core setup complete, styling ongoing)
*   **Backend API (FastAPI):** 85% (Core endpoints done, R2 logic refactoring in progress)
*   **Database (MongoDB):** 90% (Models defined, R2 tracking added)
*   **Content Retrieval:** 80% (Reddit implemented, needs robust error handling)
*   **Media Processing (Audio/Video):** 70% (Basic generation working, needs optimization)
*   **R2 Storage Integration:** 80% (Uploads working, cleanup refactoring in progress)
*   **Docker Setup:** 85% (Services running, backend image needs cleanup)
*   **Testing (Playwright):** 75% (Core flows tested, cleanup needs improvement)
*   **UI/UX:** 70% (Basic layout, needs refinement)

**Blockers:**
- None currently.

**Notes:**
- Prioritizing R2 refactoring and test cleanup before tackling minor console errors or new features.
- Need to verify the DB interaction logic within the new `/cleanup-test-data` endpoint.

### Completed Tasks
- Fixed Playwright test failure related to finding 'Your Projects' heading (`project-management.spec.ts`).
- Fixed Playwright test race condition during scene deletion by adding a polling check (`scene-operations.spec.ts`).
- Began backend refactoring: Removed unused debug endpoints related to Wrangler/Workers from `web/backend/app/api/debug.py`.

### In Progress
- Backend Refactoring:
  - Investigating R2 cleanup logic in `test-utils.ts` to ensure test artifacts are properly deleted.

### Next Steps
- Complete backend refactoring (remove unused code, improve efficiency).
- Address remaining console errors (NaN warning, investigate Imgur fetch if it becomes problematic).
- Update documentation based on refactoring changes.
- Frontend Refactoring (if needed after backend changes).
