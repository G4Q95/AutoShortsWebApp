- Fixed issue with R2 file deletion where files weren't being properly deleted 
- Root cause: incorrectly using `await` with boto3 S3 client methods, which are synchronous
- Created detailed documentation of the fix in docs/R2-Deletion-Fix.md
- Fixed issues with async/await usage in storage operations
- Added debug endpoint to test file creation and deletion 

### In Progress (Current Focus)

- **Refactor R2 Deletion Logic (Future):** Plan a refactoring session to clean up the R2 deletion code, potentially consolidating strategies and removing redundant debug code.

### Completed Tasks

*   **Fix R2 File Deletion (Bug)** - Status: âœ… Complete (March 29, 2025)
    *   Identified and fixed incorrect `async`/`await` usage with synchronous boto3 S3 client.
    *   Corrected return type handling in debug endpoints (`test_delete_sync`, `test_upload`).
    *   Fixed `list_project_files` to use correct loop for paginator.
    *   Updated `verify_cleanup` endpoint for better accuracy.
    *   **Final Fix:** Corrected `settings.r2_bucket_name` typo to `settings.R2_BUCKET_NAME` in the pattern-based deletion fallback within `project.py`'s `cleanup_project_storage` function.
    *   **Current Strategy:** Backend uses S3 API directly. Primary: Database tracked files. Fallback: Pattern matching. Worker/Wrangler are not the active methods.
