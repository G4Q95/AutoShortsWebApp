# Development Progress Tracker

**Current Date:** 2025-04-02

**Overall Progress:** 65% (Estimate)

**Development Environment:** Docker (Compose) - All services running.

**Recent Accomplishments:**
- Successfully connected backend to MongoDB Atlas (real database).
- Fixed database connection logic in `database.py`.
- Corrected test cleanup logic in `debug.py` to handle real MongoDB cursors.
- Fixed backend 500 errors during media storage (`TypeError` on `upload_file` arguments, `AttributeError` on tuple return handling) in `media_service.py`.
- Added detailed timing logs to `media_service.py` for media download/upload steps.
- Confirmed backend fixes with serial Playwright tests (`NEXT_PUBLIC_MOCK_AUDIO=false`).

**Current Implementation Tasks:**

### In Progress (As of 2025-04-02)
- **Investigating Intermittent Frontend Errors (30%):**
  - `TypeError: Failed to fetch` / `service_unavailable` errors reappeared intermittently in serial tests, primarily during cleanup phases. The 60s timeout helps, but doesn't completely eliminate them. Root cause unclear from backend logs.
- **Addressing Playwright Test Console Errors (10%):**
  - React `Warning: Received NaN for the '%s' attribute...` in video player controls.
  - `@hello-pangea/dnd` `Invariant failed: Draggable[id: ...]: Unable to find drag handle` error during scene deletion test teardown.
  - `Error initializing VideoContext: TypeError: ctx.registerTimeUpdateCallback is not a function`.

### Next Steps / Backlog
- Stabilize Playwright E2E tests (address remaining console errors and potential flakiness).
- Investigate the intermittent frontend fetch/service_unavailable errors further if they persist or block development.
- Implement robust thumbnail generation for various media types.
- Refine UI/UX based on testing feedback (e.g., loading states, error display).
- Implement full gallery support (currently only processes first image).
- Complete direct file upload functionality (`/api/v1/media/upload`).
- Enhance error handling consistency across frontend/backend.
- Add integration tests for backend services.
- Configure production deployment pipeline (Google Cloud Run / Vercel).

## Completed Tasks
- Setup base project structure (Next.js Frontend, FastAPI Backend).
- Dockerized development environment.
- Implemented core project/scene state management (frontend).
- Implemented basic UI layout (header, sidebar, main content).
- Integrated Cloudflare R2 storage via backend service (`storage.py`).
- Implemented content extraction service (`content_retrieval.py`).
- Implemented media download and storage service (`media_service.py`).
- Implemented API endpoints for content extraction and media storage.
- Integrated basic Monaco editor for scene text editing.
- Setup Playwright for E2E testing.
- Implemented basic project creation and scene addition tests.
- Integrated MongoDB Atlas connection.
- Fixed database connection logic (`database.py`).
- Corrected test data cleanup (`debug.py`) for real MongoDB.
- Fixed backend 500 error (`TypeError: R2Storage.upload_file() got an unexpected keyword argument 'filename'`) in `media_service.py`.
- Fixed backend 500 error (`AttributeError: 'tuple' object has no attribute 'get'`) in `media_service.py` by correctly handling `upload_file` return value.
- Added detailed timing logs to `media_service.py`.

## Blocker Issues
- None currently blocking core development, but intermittent frontend errors need monitoring.

## Key Decisions Made
- Increased default API client timeout from 10s to 60s (temporary for diagnosis, confirmed necessity for R2 uploads). Will monitor if this can be reduced later.
- Using simplified, flat R2 storage paths based on project/scene IDs.
- Added detailed timing logs to diagnose media storage performance.

## Overall Progress

*   **Frontend Setup (Next.js, Tailwind):** 95% (Core setup complete, styling ongoing)
*   **Backend API (FastAPI):** 85% (Core endpoints done, R2 logic refactoring in progress)
*   **Database (MongoDB):** 90% (Models defined, R2 tracking added)
*   **Content Retrieval:** 80% (Reddit implemented, needs robust error handling)
*   **Media Processing (Audio/Video):** 70% (Basic generation working, needs optimization)
*   **R2 Storage Integration:** 80% (Uploads working, cleanup refactoring in progress)
*   **Docker Setup:** 85% (Services running, backend image needs cleanup)
*   **Testing (Playwright):** 75% (All 10 E2E tests passing on `d782e56`. Cleanup handled manually.)
*   **UI/UX:** 70% (Basic layout, needs refinement)

## Completed Milestones (Recent First)

*   **March 30 (Continued):**
    *   **Fixed Choppy Audio Playback (Bug):** Resolved issue where ElevenLabs audio for *image* scenes was cutting in/out rapidly. Identified and fixed a conflict between a general `useEffect` hook managing audio based on `isPlaying` state and the specific timer/playback logic used for image scenes. Simplified image audio handling to use only `handlePlay`/`handlePause`.
    *   **Achieved Stable State:** Identified commit `d782e56` ("All Working!") as stable base where all E2E tests pass.
    *   **R2 Purge Confirmed:** Successfully ran the `r2_purger.py` script to empty the bucket.
    *   **(Reverted) Debug Test Cleanup Attempts:** Reverted recent attempts to implement automated test cleanup in Playwright due to unexpected test failures.
*   **March 30:**
    *   **Achieved Stable State:** Identified commit `d782e56` ("All Working!") as stable base where all E2E tests pass.
*   **June 2024:**
    *   **Fixed Cloudflare R2 Authentication Issues:** Diagnosed and resolved 401 Unauthorized errors when accessing the R2 bucket
    *   **Updated R2 credentials in both root and backend .env files with valid API token**
    *   **Verified successful uploads and storage operations through backend logs**
    *   **Ensured proper initialization of the R2 client in the application**
    *   **Rebuilt Docker containers to properly apply updated environment variables**
    *   **Created standalone `r2_purger.py` script for bulk cleaning of R2 bucket**
*   **March 29, 2025:**
    *   **Fixed R2 File Deletion (Bug):** Identified and fixed incorrect `async`/`await` usage with synchronous boto3 S3 client.
    *   **Corrected return type handling in debug endpoints (`test_delete_sync`, `test_upload`).**
    *   **Fixed `list_project_files` to use correct loop for paginator.**
    *   **Updated `verify_cleanup` endpoint for better accuracy.**
    *   **Corrected `settings.r2_bucket_name` typo to `settings.R2_BUCKET_NAME` in the pattern-based deletion fallback within `project.py`'s `cleanup_project_storage` function.**
    *   **Current Strategy:** Backend uses S3 API directly. Primary: Database tracked files. Fallback: Pattern matching. Worker/Wrangler are not the active methods.**

## In Progress / Next Steps

1.  **Video Voice Generation:**
    *   **Status:** Active.
    *   **Goal:** Integrate ElevenLabs API for voice generation based on scene text. Add UI elements for voice selection and preview.
2.  **Video Preview & Customization:**
    *   **Status:** Next Up.
    *   **Goal:** Implement the `/projects/{id}/preview` route. Allow users to customize scene timings, potentially visuals, and preview the final video sequence.
3.  **(Future) Re-evaluate Test Cleanup Strategy:**
    *   **Status:** On Hold.
    *   **Goal:** Develop a reliable and non-interfering method to clean up test-generated projects and R2 files after Playwright runs. Current method: Manual execution of `r2_purger.py`.
4.  **(Future) R2 Refactoring:**
    *   **Status:** On Hold. (See `docs/R2-Refactoring-Plan.md`)
    *   **Goal:** Simplify and clean up R2 interaction code, remove unused config/code.
5.  **Fix Flaky Tests (Backend Connection):** Investigate and resolve the intermittent `service_unavailable` errors occurring during Playwright tests, preventing the frontend from reliably communicating with the backend. (0%)
6.  **Refactor Media Handling & R2 Integration:** Complete the refactoring of media downloading, storage (R2), and preview logic across frontend and backend. (Est. 75% complete)
  - Frontend context and download manager improvements.
  - Backend R2 upload endpoints.
  - Ensuring smooth preview playback with R2 URLs.

## Known Issues / Blockers

*   **(Minor) Browser Console Errors:** Some persistent errors (CORS, NaN, VideoContext init) noted during test runs - investigate later.
*   **(Deferred) Test Cleanup Automation:** No automated cleanup after tests. Requires manual `r2_purger.py` execution.
