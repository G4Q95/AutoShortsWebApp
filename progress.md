# Auto Shorts Web App - Development Progress

## Current Development Focus

The current focus is on completing the video processing pipeline and improving the existing project workspace:

### Completed Tasks
- âœ… Fixed the Not-Found page component error
- âœ… Enhanced Reddit content extraction to properly handle redirects and fetch media
- âœ… Added project name input step for video creation
- âœ… Implemented proper project saving functionality with MongoDB backend
- âœ… Set up projects list page with viewing/deletion capabilities
- âœ… Created MongoDB Atlas integration for project persistence
- âœ… Implemented project workspace with drag-and-drop functionality
- âœ… Created scene components for displaying media and text from Reddit URLs
- âœ… Added scene reordering capability using @hello-pangea/dnd

### In Progress
- ðŸ”„ Developing video processing integration:
  - Connecting the frontend project workspace to the backend video processing API
  - Implementing progress tracking for video generation
  - Adding video preview and download functionality
- ðŸ”„ Enhancing content extraction:
  - Adding support for more sources beyond Reddit
  - Improving error handling for media extraction
  - Implementing retry mechanisms for failed content retrievals

## Component Implementation Status

### Frontend Components

- `SceneComponent`: Display media and text from a URL - COMPLETED
- `ProjectProvider`: Context for project state management - COMPLETED
- `MediaContentItem`: Media display with support for different types - COMPLETED
- Scene reordering with react-beautiful-dnd - COMPLETED
- Project persistence with MongoDB - COMPLETED
- Video processing integration - IN PROGRESS (50% complete)

### Backend Services
- Reddit content extraction API - COMPLETED
- MongoDB Atlas integration - COMPLETED
- Video processing pipeline - IN PROGRESS (70% complete)
- Cloud storage integration - IN PROGRESS (40% complete)

## Checkpoint: "mongodb-project-storage-complete"

This checkpoint marks the successful implementation of MongoDB Atlas for project storage, replacing the previous localStorage implementation.

### What We've Accomplished:

1. **MongoDB Integration**:
   - âœ… Implemented MongoDB Atlas connection in backend
   - âœ… Created project CRUD API endpoints
   - âœ… Added proper error handling and connection fallbacks
   - âœ… Implemented MongoDB document models with proper schemas

2. **Improved Project Persistence**:
   - âœ… Projects are now stored in MongoDB collection
   - âœ… Added server-side validation for project data
   - âœ… Implemented robust error handling for database operations
   - âœ… Created fallback to mock database when MongoDB is unavailable

3. **Frontend-Backend Integration**:
   - âœ… Connected frontend project management to backend API
   - âœ… Implemented proper loading states during database operations
   - âœ… Added error handling for network failures

## Timeline Status

According to `PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`, we are in Phase 2 of the project, focused on connecting the frontend workspace to backend processing. We have completed approximately 80% of this phase:

- The content extraction from Reddit is working correctly
- The project workspace UI is complete with scene organization
- The drag-and-drop functionality for reordering is implemented
- Project persistence with MongoDB is functioning properly

## Next Steps

1. **Video Processing Integration**:
   - Complete the video processing pipeline
   - Connect frontend to backend for video generation
   - Implement progress tracking for video creation
   - Add preview and download capabilities

2. **Content Enhancement**:
   - Add bulk import of multiple URLs
   - Improve error handling for failed content extraction
   - Add retry options for failed media downloads

3. **UI/UX Improvements**:
   - Add confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
   - Implement keyboard shortcuts for common tasks
   - Add loading states/skeletons while content loads

4. **Advanced Features**:
   - User authentication with Google OAuth
   - Cloud storage for finished videos
   - Video library/gallery view
   - Sharing capabilities

## Known Issues

- Occasional issues with Reddit API rate limiting
- Video processing queue management needs refinement
- Large projects with many scenes may experience performance issues
- Project list pagination needed for scalability
